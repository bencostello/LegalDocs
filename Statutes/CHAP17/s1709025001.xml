In lieu of the levy of such tax, the mayor and city council of any such city or the board of trustees of any village may establish by ordinance such rates for such sewer service as may be deemed by them to be fair and reasonable, to be collected from either the owner or the person, firm, or corporation requesting the services at such times, either monthly, quarterly, or otherwise, as may be specified in the ordinance. All sewer charges shall be a lien upon the premises or real estate for which the same is used or supplied. Such lien shall be enforced in such manner as the local governing body provides by ordinance. The charges thus made when collected shall be placed either in a separate fund or in a combined water and sewer fund and used exclusively for the purpose of maintenance and repairs of the sewer system, or the water and sewer system, in such city or village.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1903, c. 22, &#167; 9, p. 258; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 5048; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 4217; </para><para>Laws 1923, c. 188, &#167; 1, p. 432; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 17-156; </para><para>Laws 1943, c. 33, &#167; 2, p. 151; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 17-925.01; </para><para>Laws 1947, c. 51, &#167; 2, p. 172; </para><para>Laws 1951, c. 37, &#167; 1, p. 138; </para><para>Laws 1953, c. 287, &#167; 22, p. 944; </para><para>Laws 1979, LB 187, &#167; 59; </para><para>Laws 1992, LB 719A, &#167; 61; </para><para>Laws 1997, LB 67, &#167; 1.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
