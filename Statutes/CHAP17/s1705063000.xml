of the second class and village by ordinance (a) may require lots or pieces of ground within
the city or village to be drained or filled so as to prevent stagnant water
or any other nuisance accumulating thereon,
(b) may

or village to keep the lot or piece of ground and the adjoining streets and
alleys free of any growth of twelve inches or more in height of weeds, grasses,
or worthless vegetation, and (c) may prohibit and control
the throwing, depositing, or accumulation of litter on any lot or piece of
ground within the city or village.</para>
<para>(2) Except as provided in subsection (6) of
this section, any city of the second class and village may by

work done. The costs and expenses of any such work shall be paid by the owner.
If unpaid for two months after such work is done, the city or village may
either (a) levy and assess the costs and expenses of the work upon the lot

for improvements are levied and assessed or (b) recover in a civil action
