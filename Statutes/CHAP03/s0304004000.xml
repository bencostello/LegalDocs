Upon the filing of such application, the director shall make an investigation and an aeronautical study of such proposed construction and its effect, if any, upon air navigation, and the health, welfare, and safety of the public. If the director, upon such investigation, shall determine that such proposed structure will not constitute a hazard to air navigation and will not interfere unduly with the public right of freedom of transit in commerce through the air space affected thereby, the director shall issue to the applicant a permit, required by section 3-403, authorizing the erection and construction of such structure, subject to such conditions as to marking and lighting as the division may prescribe by its rules and regulations, authorized by section 3-407. If the director does not so determine, the director shall deny the application. In making such investigation, aeronautical study, and determination, the director shall consider (1) the character of flying operations expected to be conducted in the area concerned, (2) the nature of the terrain, (3) the character of the neighborhood, (4) the uses to which the property concerned is devoted or adaptable, (5) the proximity to existing airports, airways, control areas, and control zones, (6) the height of existing adjacent structures, and (7) all the facts and circumstances existing. The director shall impose only such restrictions or requirements as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of sections 3-401 to 3-409.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1955, c. 7, &#167; 4, p. 68; </para><para>Laws 2017, LB339, &#167; 66. </para><operativedate>July 1, 2017</operativedate></source></law>
