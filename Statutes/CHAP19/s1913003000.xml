Such resolution of submission shall, among other things, set forth a clear description of the improvement planned, the estimated cost according to the prevailing costs, the amount of annual levy over a definite period of years, not exceeding ten years, required to provide such cost, and the specific name or designation for the sinking fund sought to be established to carry out the planned improvement, together with a statement of the proposition for placement upon the ballot at such election. Notice of the submission of the proposition, together with a copy of the official ballot containing the same, shall be published in its entirety three successive weeks before the day of the election in a legal newspaper published in the municipality or, if no legal newspaper is published therein, in some legal newspaper published in the county in which such city or village is located and of general circulation. If no legal newspaper is published in the county, such notice shall be published in some legal newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the municipality is located. No such sinking fund shall be established unless the same shall have been authorized by a majority or more of the legal votes of such city or village cast for or against the proposition. If less than a majority of the legal votes favor the establishment of the sinking fund, the planned improvement shall not be made, no annual tax shall be levied therefor, and no sinking fund or sinking funds shall be established in connection therewith, but such resolution of submission shall immediately be repealed. If the proposition shall carry at such election in the manner prescribed in this section, the local governing body and its successors in office shall proceed to do all things authorized under such resolution of submission but never inconsistent with sections 19-1301 to 19-1304. Provisions of the statutes of this state relating to election of officers, voting places, election apparatus and blanks, preparation and form of ballots, information to voters, delivery of ballots, conduct of elections, manner of voting, counting of votes, records and certificates of elections, and recounts of votes, so far as applicable, shall apply to voting on the proposition under this section.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1939, c. 12, &#167; 3, p. 81; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 19-1303; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 19-1303; </para><para>Laws 1961, c. 59, &#167; 2, p. 217; </para><para>Laws 1986, LB 960, &#167; 14. </para></source><annotation><para>This section does not apply to creating a sinking fund for payment of interest and principal of bonds.
