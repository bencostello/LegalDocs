Two of the regular members may be residents of the area over which the municipality is authorized to exercise extraterritorial zoning and subdivision regulation. When there is a sufficient number of residents in the area over which the municipality exercises extraterritorial zoning and subdivision regulation, one regular member of the commission shall be a resident from such area. If it is determined by the city council or village board that a sufficient number of residents reside in the area subject to extraterritorial zoning or subdivision regulation, and no such resident is a regular member of the commission, the first available vacancy on the commission shall be filled by the appointment of such an individual. For purposes of this section, a sufficient number of residents shall mean: (a) For a village, two hundred residents; (b) for a city of the second class, five hundred residents; and (c) for a city of the first class, one thousand residents. A number of commissioners equal to a majority of the number of regular members appointed to the commission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business. All regular members of the commission shall serve without compensation and shall hold no other municipal office except when appointed to serve on the board of adjustment as provided in section 19-908. The term of each regular member shall be three years, except that three regular members of the first commission to be so appointed shall serve for terms of one year, three for terms of two years, and three for terms of three years. All regular members shall hold office until their successors are appointed. Any member may, after a public hearing before the council or village board, be removed by the mayor with the consent of a majority vote of the members elected to the council or village board for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, or other good and sufficient cause. Vacancies occurring otherwise than through the expiration of term shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by the mayor.</para><para>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, the planning commission for any city of the second class or village may have either five, seven, or nine regular members as the city council or village board of trustees establishes by ordinance. If a city or village planning commission has either five or seven regular members, approximately one-third of the regular members of the first commission shall serve for terms of one year, one-third for terms of two years, and one-third for terms of three years.</para><para>(3) A city of the first or second class or a village may, by ordinance, provide for the appointment of one alternate member to the planning commission who shall be chosen by the mayor with the approval of a majority vote of the elected members of the council or village board. The alternate member shall serve without compensation and shall hold no other municipal office. The term of the alternate member shall be three years, and he or she shall hold office until his or her successor is appointed and approved. The alternate member may be removed from office in the same manner as a regular member. If the alternate member position becomes vacant other than through the expiration of the term, the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by the mayor with the approval of a majority vote of the elected members of the council or village board. The alternate member may attend any meeting and may serve as a voting and participating member of the commission at any time when less than the full number of regular commission members is present and capable of voting.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1937, c. 39, &#167; 3, p. 176; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 18-2103; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 18-1303; </para><para>Laws 1975, LB 410, &#167; 9; </para><para>Laws 1978, LB 186, &#167; 3; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1983), &#167; 18-1303; </para><para>Laws 1988, LB 934, &#167; 6; </para><para>Laws 1995, LB 193, &#167; 1. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
