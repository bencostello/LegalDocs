<para>(b) Beginning December 31, 1998, and every four years thereafter, if
such retirement plan is a defined benefit plan, the city council or village
board shall cause to be prepared a quadrennial report and shall file the same

of Public Accounts a copy of each report. The Auditor of Public Accounts may prepare a review of such
report pursuant to section 84-304.02 but is not required to do so. The

officer or firefighter employed by such city on or prior to the date such
city becomes a city of the second class shall retain the level of benefits
established by the Legislature for police officers or firefighters employed
by a city of the first class on the date such city becomes a city of the second
class.</para>
