The owner shall also receive a credit for the unused portion of the motor vehicle tax and fee based upon the number of unexpired months remaining in the registration year. When the owner registers a replacement motor vehicle or trailer at the time of filing such affidavit, the credit may be immediately applied against the registration fee and the motor vehicle tax and fee for the replacement motor vehicle or trailer. When no such replacement motor vehicle or trailer is so registered, the county treasurer shall forward the application and affidavit, if any, to the State Treasurer who shall determine the amount, if any, of the allowable credit for the registration fee and issue a credit certificate to the owner. For the motor vehicle tax and fee, the county treasurer shall determine the amount, if any, of the allowable credit and issue a credit certificate to the owner. When such motor vehicle or trailer is removed from service within the same month in which it was registered, no credits shall be allowed for such month. The credits may be applied against taxes and fees for new or replacement motor vehicles or trailers incurred within one year after cancellation of registration of the motor vehicle or trailer for which the credits were allowed. When any such motor vehicle or trailer is reregistered within the same registration year in which its registration has been canceled, the taxes and fees shall be that portion of the registration fee and the motor vehicle tax and fee for the remainder of the registration year.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2005, LB 274, &#167; 96; </para><para>Laws 2007, LB570, &#167; 6; </para><para>Laws 2012, LB801, &#167; 62; </para><para>Laws 2014, LB383, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 2015, LB220, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 2016, LB474, &#167; 6; </para><para>Laws 2017, LB46, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 2017, LB263, &#167; 35. </para></source></law>
