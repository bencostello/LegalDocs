who is affiliated with a manufacturer or distributor or who, directly or indirectly

the manufacturer or distributor. A person is controlled by a manufacturer
or distributor if the manufacturer or distributor has the authority directly
or indirectly, by law or by agreement of the parties, to direct or influence
the management and policies of the person. A franchise agreement with a Nebraska-licensed
dealer which conforms to and is subject to the
Motor Vehicle Industry Regulation Act is not control for purposes
of this section.</para>

shall not directly or indirectly:</para>
<para>(a) Own an interest in a franchise, franchisee, or consumer care or
service facility, except that a manufacturer or distributor may hold stock

so long as the manufacturer or distributor does not by virtue of holding such
stock operate or control the franchise, franchisee, or consumer care or service
facility;</para>

<para>(a) The person from whom the manufacturer or distributor acquired the
franchise was a franchisee; and</para>
<para>(b) The franchise is for sale by the manufacturer or distributor.</para>
<para>(4) For purposes of broadening the diversity of its franchisees and
enhancing opportunities for qualified persons who lack the resources to purchase
a franchise outright, but for no other purpose, a manufacturer or distributor
may temporarily own an interest in a franchise if the manufacturer's or distributor's
participation in the franchise is in a bona fide relationship with a franchisee
and the franchisee:</para>
<para>(a) Has made a significant investment in the franchise, which investment
is subject to loss;</para>
<para>(b) Has an ownership interest in the franchise; and</para>
<para>(c) Operates the franchise under a plan to acquire full ownership of
the franchise within a reasonable time and under reasonable terms and conditions.</para>
<para>(5) On a showing of good cause by a manufacturer or distributor, the
board may extend the time limit set forth in subsection (3) of this section.
An extension may not exceed twelve months. An application for an extension
after the first extension is granted is subject to protest by a franchisee
of the same line-make whose franchise is located in the same community as
the franchise owned or controlled by the manufacturer or distributor.</para>
<para>(6) The prohibition in subdivision (2)(b) of this section shall not
