LPC-learner's permit from the department by
making application to an examiner of the department. An
applicant shall present proof to the examiner that he or she holds a valid
Class O license or commercial driver's license or shall successfully complete
the requirements for the Class O license before an LPC-learner's permit is
issued. An applicant shall also successfully complete the commercial driver's
license general knowledge examination under section 60-4,155. Upon application,
the examination may be waived if the applicant presents a Nebraska commercial
driver's license which is valid or has been expired for less than one year,
presents a valid commercial driver's license from another state, or is renewing
an LPC-learner's permit. The LPC-learner's permit shall be valid for a period
of six months and shall be renewed only once within any two-year period. The
county treasurer shall charge the fee prescribed in section 60-4,115 for the
issuance or renewal of an LPC-learner's permit.</para>
