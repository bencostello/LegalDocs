An applicant shall present proof to the examiner that he or she holds a valid Class O license or commercial driver's license or shall successfully complete the requirements for the Class O license before an LPC-learner's permit is issued. An applicant shall also successfully complete the commercial driver's license general knowledge examination under section 60-4,155. Upon application, the examination may be waived if the applicant presents a Nebraska commercial driver's license which is valid or has been expired for less than one year, presents a valid commercial driver's license from another state, or is renewing an LPC-learner's permit. The LPC-learner's permit shall be valid for a period of six months and shall be renewed only once within any two-year period.
