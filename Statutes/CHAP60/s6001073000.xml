insurance company; total loss settlement; when issued.</catchline><para>When
an insurance company acquires a salvage vehicle through payment of a total
loss settlement on account of damage, the company shall obtain the certificate
of title from the owner, surrender such certificate of title to the county treasurer, and make application
for a salvage branded certificate of title which shall be assigned when the
company transfers ownership. An insurer shall take title to a salvage vehicle
for which a total loss settlement is made unless the owner of the salvage
vehicle elects to retain the salvage vehicle. If the owner elects to retain
the salvage vehicle, the insurance company shall notify the department of
such fact in a format prescribed by the department. The department shall immediately
enter the salvage brand onto the computerized record of the vehicle. The insurance
company shall also notify the owner of the owner's responsibility to comply
with this section. The owner shall, within thirty days after the settlement
of the loss, forward the properly endorsed acceptable certificate of title
to the county treasurer in
the county designated in section 60-144. The county treasurer shall, upon receipt
of the certificate of title, issue a salvage branded certificate of title
for the vehicle.</para>
