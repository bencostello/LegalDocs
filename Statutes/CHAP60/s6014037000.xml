acts with respect to new motor vehicles.</catchline><para>In addition to the
restrictions imposed by section 60-1436, a manufacturer or distributor shall
not:</para>
<para>(1) Fail to deliver new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle parts or
accessories within a reasonable time and in reasonable quantities relative
to the new motor vehicle dealer's market area and facilities, unless the failure
is caused by acts or occurrences beyond the control of the manufacturer or
distributor or unless the failure results from an order by the new motor vehicle
dealer in excess of quantities reasonably and fairly allocated by the manufacturer
or distributor;</para>
<para>(2) Refuse to disclose to a new motor vehicle dealer the method and
manner of distribution of new motor vehicles by the manufacturer or distributor;</para>
<para>(3) Refuse to disclose to a new motor vehicle dealer the total number
of new motor vehicles of a given model which the manufacturer or distributor
has sold during the current model year within the dealer's marketing district,
zone, or region, whichever geographical area is the smallest;</para>
<para>(4) Increase the price of any new motor vehicle which the new motor
vehicle dealer had ordered and delivered to the same retail consumer for whom
the vehicle was ordered, if the order was made prior to the dealer's receipt
of the written official price increase notification. A sales contract signed
by a private retail consumer and binding on the dealer shall constitute evidence
of such order. In the event of manufacturer or distributor price reduction
or cash rebate, the amount of any reduction or rebate received by a dealer
shall be passed on to the private retail consumer by the dealer. Any price
reduction in excess of five dollars shall apply to all vehicles in the dealer's
inventory which were subject to the price reduction. A price difference applicable
to a new model or series of motor vehicles at the time of the introduction
of the new model or series shall not be considered a price increase or price
decrease. This subdivision shall not apply to price changes caused by the
following:</para>
<para>(a) The addition to a motor vehicle of required or optional equipment
pursuant to state or federal law;</para>
<para>(b) In the case of foreign-made vehicles or components, revaluation
of the United States dollar; or</para>
<para>(c) Any increase in transportation charges due to an increase in rates
charged by a common carrier or other transporter;</para>
<para>(5) Fail or refuse to sell or offer to sell to all franchised new motor
vehicle dealers in a line-make every new motor vehicle sold or offered for
sale to any franchised new motor vehicle dealer of the same line-make. However,
the failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall not be considered
a violation of this section if the failure is due to a lack of manufacturing
capacity or to a strike or labor difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
embargo, or any other cause over which the franchisor has no control. A manufacturer
or distributor shall not require that any of its new motor vehicle dealers
located in this state pay any extra fee, purchase unreasonable or unnecessary
quantities of advertising displays or other materials, or remodel, renovate,
or recondition the new motor vehicle dealer's existing facilities in order
to receive any particular model or series of vehicles manufactured or distributed
by the manufacturer for which the dealers have a valid franchise. Notwithstanding
the provisions of this subdivision, nothing contained in this section shall
be deemed to prohibit or prevent a manufacturer from requiring that its franchised
dealers located in this state purchase special tools or equipment, stock reasonable
quantities of certain parts, or participate in training programs which are
reasonably necessary for those dealers to sell or service any model or series
of new motor vehicles. This subdivision shall not apply to manufacturers of
recreational vehicles;</para>
<para>(6) Fail to offer dealers
of a specific line-make a new franchise agreement containing substantially
similar terms and conditions for sales of the line-make if the ownership of
the manufacturer or distributor changes or there is a change in the plan or
system of distribution;</para><para>(7)
Take an adverse action against a dealer because the dealer sells or leases
a motor vehicle that is later exported to a location outside the United States.
A franchise provision that allows a manufacturer or distributor to take adverse
action against a dealer because the dealer sells or leases a motor vehicle
that is later exported to a location outside the United States is enforceable
only if, at the time of the original sale or lease, the dealer knew or reasonably
should have known that the motor vehicle would be exported to a location outside
the United States. A dealer is presumed to have no knowledge that a motor
vehicle the dealer sells or leases will be exported to a location outside
the United States if, under the laws of a state of the United States (a) the
motor vehicle is titled, (b) the motor vehicle is registered, and (c) applicable
state and local taxes are paid for the motor vehicle. Such presumption may
be rebutted by direct, clear, and convincing evidence that the dealer knew
or reasonably should have known at the time of the original sale or lease
that the motor vehicle would be exported to a location outside the United
States. Except as otherwise permitted by subdivision (7) of this section,
a franchise provision that allows a manufacturer or distributor to take adverse
action against a dealer because the dealer sells or leases a motor vehicle
that is later exported to a location outside the United States is void and
unenforceable;</para><para>(8)
Discriminate against a dealer holding a franchise for a line-make of the manufacturer
or distributor in favor of other dealers of the same line-make in this state
by:</para><para>(a)
Selling or offering to sell a new motor vehicle to a dealer at a lower actual
price, including the price for vehicle transportation, than the actual price
at which the same model similarly equipped is offered to or is available to
another dealer in this state during a similar time period; or</para>
<para>(b) Using a promotional
program or device or an incentive, payment, or other benefit, whether paid
at the time of the sale of the new motor vehicle to the dealer or later, that
results in the sale or offer to sell a new motor vehicle to a dealer at a
lower price, including the price for vehicle transportation, than the price
at which the same model similarly equipped is offered or is available to another
dealer in this state during a similar time period. This subdivision shall
not prohibit a promotional or incentive program that is functionally available
to competing dealers of the same line-make in this state on substantially
comparable terms; or</para><para>(9)
Make any express or implied statement or representation directly or indirectly
that the dealer is under any obligation whatsoever to offer to sell or sell
any extended service contract or extended maintenance plan offered, sold,
backed by, or sponsored by the manufacturer or distributor or to sell, assign,
or transfer any of the dealer's retail sales contracts or leases in this state
on motor vehicles manufactured or sold by the manufacturer or distributor
to a finance company or class of finance companies, leasing company or class
of leasing companies, or other specified person, because of any relationship
or affiliation between the manufacturer or distributor and the finance company
or companies, leasing company or leasing companies, or the specified person
or persons.</para><para>Any
such statements, threats, promises, acts, contracts, or offers of contracts,
when their effect may be to lessen or eliminate competition or tend to create
a monopoly, are declared unfair trade practices and unfair methods of competition
and are prohibited.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1984, LB 825, &#167; 20; </para><para>Laws 1999, LB 632, &#167; 8; </para><para>Laws 2010, LB816, &#167; 82.</para></source>  </law>
