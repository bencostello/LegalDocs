until the implementation date designated by the director pursuant to section
60-462.02. In and for each county in the State of Nebraska, the director shall
appoint as his or her agents one or more examiners who shall examine all applicants
for an operator's license as provided in section 60-4,114 except as otherwise
provided in subsection (8) of section 60-4,122. The director may, in his or
her discretion, also appoint one or more examining officers with similar powers
as are set forth in section 60-4,114. The same examiner may be assigned to
one or more counties by the director. Each county shall furnish office space
for the administration of the operator's license examination. The examiner
shall conduct the examination of applicants and deliver to each successful
applicant a certificate entitling such applicant to secure an operator's license.
If the examiner refuses to issue such certificate for cause, he or she shall
state such cause in writing and deliver the same to the applicant. The successful
applicant shall, within ninety days, present his or her certificate to the
county treasurer who shall immediately issue the operator's license and collect
the fee therefor. The county treasurer shall report the issuance of such licenses
to the department within five days after issuance.</para><para>(2)(a) This
subsection applies beginning on the implementation date designated by the
director pursuant to section 60-462.02. In and for each county in the State

personnel who shall examine all applicants for a state identification card
or an operator's license as provided in section 60-4,114 except as otherwise
provided in subsection (8) of section 60-4,122. The same department personnel
may be assigned to one or more counties by the director. Each county shall
furnish office space for the administration of the operator's license examination.
The department personnel shall conduct the examination of applicants and deliver
to each successful applicant an issuance certificate. The certificate may
be presented to the county treasurer of any county within ninety days after
issuance, and the county treasurer shall collect the fee and surcharge as
provided in section 60-4,115 and issue a receipt which is valid for up to
thirty days. If an operator's license is being issued, the receipt shall also
authorize driving privileges for such thirty-day period. If the department
personnel refuse to issue an issuance certificate for cause, the department
personnel shall state such cause in writing and deliver such written cause
to the applicant.</para><para>(b) The department may provide for the central
production and issuance of operators' licenses and state identification cards.
Production shall take place at a secure production facility designated by
the director. The licenses and cards shall be of such a design and produced
in such a way as to discourage, to the maximum extent possible, fraud in applicant
enrollment, identity theft, and the forgery and counterfeiting of such licenses
and cards. Delivery of an operator's license or state identification card
shall be to the mailing address provided by the applicant at the time of application.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws
