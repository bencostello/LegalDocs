vehicle registration.</catchline><para>Any owner who has two or more motor
vehicles or trailers required to be registered under the Motor Vehicle Registration
Act may register all such motor vehicles or trailers on a calendar-year basis
or on an annual basis for the same registration period beginning in a month
chosen by the owner. When electing to establish the same registration period
for all such motor vehicles or trailers, the owner shall pay the registration
fee, the motor vehicle tax imposed in section 60-3,185, and the motor vehicle
fee imposed in section 60-3,190 on each motor vehicle for the number of months
necessary to extend its current registration period to the registration period
under which all such motor vehicles or trailers will be registered. Credit
shall be given for registration paid on each motor vehicle or trailer when
the motor vehicle or trailer has a later expiration date than that chosen
by the owner except as otherwise provided in sections 60-3,121, 60-3,122.02,
and 60-3,128. Thereafter all such motor vehicles or trailers shall be registered
on an annual basis starting in the month chosen by the owner.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws
