<para>(1) Any person who operates a dairy operation located within
the brand inspection area may make application to the Nebraska Brand Committee
for registration as a registered dairy. The application form shall be prescribed
by the brand committee and shall be made available by the director of the
brand committee for this purpose upon written request. If the applicant is
an individual, the application shall include the applicant's social security
number. After the brand committee has received a properly completed application,
an agent of the brand committee shall within thirty days make an investigation
to determine if the following requirements are satisfied:</para>
<para>(a) The operator's dairy must be permanently fenced; and</para>
<para>(b) The operator must identify each animal individually as
directed by the Nebraska Brand Committee.</para>
<para>If the application is satisfactory, and upon payment of a
registration fee by the applicant, the brand committee shall issue a registration
number and registration certificate valid for one year unless rescinded for
cause. If the registration is rescinded for cause, any registration fee shall
be forfeited by the applicant. The initial fee
for a registered dairy shall be an amount for a registered
dairy having one thousand head or less capacity and an equal amount for each
additional one thousand head capacity, or part thereof, of such registered
dairy. For each subsequent
year, the renewal fee for a registered dairy shall be an amount for the first
one thousand head or portion thereof of average annual inventory of dairy
cattle of the registered dairy and an equal amount for each additional one
thousand head or portion thereof of average annual inventory of dairy cattle
of the registered dairy. The brand committee shall set the fee
per one thousand head capacity or
average annual inventory so as to correspond with the inspection
fee provided under section 54-1,108. The registration fee shall be paid on
an annual basis.</para>
<para>(2) The brand committee may adopt and promulgate rules and
regulations for the operation of registered dairies to assure that brand laws
are complied with, that registered dairy shipping certificates are available,
and that proper records are maintained. This section shall not be construed
as prohibiting the operation of nonregistered dairies.</para>
<para>(3) A registered dairy is subject to inspection at any reasonable
time at the discretion of the brand committee and its authorized agents, and
the operator shall show cattle purchase records or certificates of inspection
to cover all cattle in his or her dairy. Cattle having originated from any
such registered dairy may from time to time, at the discretion of the committee,
be subject to a spot-check inspection and audit at the destination to enable
the brand committee to assure satisfactory compliance with the brand laws
by the registered dairy operator.</para>
<para>(4) The operator of a registered dairy shall keep cattle inventory
records. A form for such purpose shall be prescribed by the brand committee.
The brand committee and its employees may from time to time make spot checks
and audits of registered dairies and the records of cattle in such registered
dairies.</para>
<para>(5) The brand committee may rescind or suspend the registration
of any registered dairy operator who fails to cooperate or violates the laws
or rules and regulations of the brand committee covering registered dairies.</para>
