The Legislature further finds that trends in livestock production suggest a need to identify and address factors that affect the viability and expansion of livestock production. Those factors include the impact of livestock production on the state's economy and its communities, all applicable regulatory agencies, and the latest technology available to enhance the livestock industry. It is the intent of the Legislature to seek reasonable means to nurture and support the livestock sector of this state.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2003, LB 754, &#167; 1. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
