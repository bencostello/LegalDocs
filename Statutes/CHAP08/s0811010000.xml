or other instrumentality thereof or any certificate of deposit for any of
the foregoing;</para>
<para>(2) Any security issued or guaranteed by Canada, any Canadian province,
any political subdivision of any such province, any agency or corporate or
other instrumentality of one or more of the foregoing, or any other foreign
government with which the United States currently maintains diplomatic relations,
if the security is recognized as a valid obligation by the issuer or guarantor;</para>
<para>(3) Any security issued or guaranteed by any federal credit union or
any credit union or similar association organized and supervised under the
laws of this state;</para>
<para>(4) Any security issued or guaranteed by any railroad, other common

<para>(5)(a) Any security listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange, the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, Tier I of the Pacific Stock Exchange, Tier I of the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, or any other stock exchange or market system
approved by the director, if, in each case, quotations have been available
and public trading has taken place for such class of security prior to the

called for by subscription rights or warrants so listed or approved; or any
warrant or right to purchase or subscribe to any of the foregoing or to any

<para>(b) The issuer of any security which has been approved for listing or
designation on notice of issuance on such exchanges or market systems, and
for which no quotations have been available and no public trading has taken
place for any of such issuer's securities, may rely upon the exemption stated
in subdivision (5)(a) of this section, if a notice is filed with the director,
together with a filing fee of two hundred dollars, prior to first use of a
disclosure document covering such securities in this state, except that failure
to file such notice in a timely manner may be cured by the director in his
or her discretion.</para>
<para>(c) The director may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations which,
after notice to such exchange or market system and an opportunity to be heard,
remove any such exchange or market system from the exemption stated in subdivision
(5)(a) of this section if the director finds that the listing requirements
or market surveillance of such exchange or market system is such that the
continued availability of such exemption for such exchange or market system
is not in the public interest and that removal is necessary for the protection
of investors;</para>
<para>(6) Any security which meets all of the following conditions:</para>
<para>(a) The issuer is organized under the laws of the United States or a
state or has appointed a duly authorized agent in the United States for service

<para>(b) A class of the issuer's securities is required to be and is registered
under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has been so registered
for the three years immediately preceding the offering date;</para>
<para>(c) Neither the issuer nor a significant subsidiary has had a material
default during the last seven years, or during the issuer's existence if such

dividends, or sinking-fund installments on preferred stock or indebtedness
for borrowed money or (ii) rentals under leases with terms of three or more
years;</para>
<para>(d) The issuer has had consolidated net income, without taking into
account extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes,

its last fiscal year, and if the offering is of interest-bearing securities
the issuer has had for its last fiscal year net income before deduction for
income taxes and depreciation of at least one and one-half times the issuer's
annual interest expense, taking into account the proposed offering and the
intended use of the proceeds. However, if the issuer of the securities is
a finance company which has liquid assets of at least one hundred five percent
of its liabilities, other than deferred income taxes, deferred investment
tax credit, capital stock, and surplus, at the end of its last five fiscal
years, the net income requirement before deduction for interest expense shall
be one and one-fourth times its annual interest expense. For purposes of this
subdivision: (i) Last fiscal year means the most recent year for which audited
financial statements are available, if such statements cover a fiscal period
ending not more than fifteen months from the commencement of the offering;
(ii) finance company means a company engaged primarily in the business of
wholesale, retail, installment, mortgage, commercial, industrial, or consumer
financing, banking, or factoring; and (iii) liquid assets means (A) cash,
(B) receivables payable on demand or not more than twelve months following
the close of the company's last fiscal year less applicable reserves and unearned
income, and (C) readily marketable securities less applicable reserves and
unearned income;</para>
<para>(e) If the offering is of stock or shares other than preferred stock
or shares, such securities have voting rights which include (i) the right
to have at least as many votes per share and (ii) the right to vote on at
least as many general corporate decisions as each of the issuer's outstanding
classes of stock or shares, except as otherwise required by law; and</para>
<para>(f) If the offering is of stock or shares other than preferred stock
or shares, such securities are owned beneficially or of record on any date
within six months prior to the commencement of the offering by at least one
thousand two hundred persons, and on such date there are at least seven hundred
fifty thousand such shares outstanding with an aggregate market value of at
least three million seven hundred fifty thousand dollars based on the average
bid price for such day. When determining the number of persons who are beneficial
owners of the stock or shares of an issuer, for purposes of this subdivision,
the issuer or broker-dealer may rely in good faith upon written information
furnished by the record owners;</para>
<para>(7) Any security issued or guaranteed as to both principal and interest
by an international bank of which the United States is a member; or</para>
<para>(8) Any security issued by any person organized and operated not for
