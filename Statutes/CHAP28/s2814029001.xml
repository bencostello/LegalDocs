The Legislature further finds that the growing number of minors who start smoking is staggering and even more abhorrent are the ages at which such children begin this deadly habit. The Legislature has established an age restriction on the use of tobacco products by minors. To ensure that the use of tobacco products among minors is discouraged to the maximum extent possible, it is the intent of the Legislature to ban the use of vending machines and similar devices to dispense tobacco products in facilities, buildings, or areas which are open to the general public within Nebraska.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1992, LB 130, &#167; 1. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
