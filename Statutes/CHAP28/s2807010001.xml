<para>(1) The Legislature
declares that the public policy of the State of Nebraska is to protect children
whose health or welfare may be jeopardized by abuse or neglect. The Legislature
recognizes that most families want to keep their children safe, but circumstances
or conditions sometimes interfere with their ability to do so. Families and
children are best served by interventions that engage their protective capacities
and address immediate safety concerns and ongoing risks of child abuse or
neglect. In furtherance of this public policy and the family policy and principles
set forth in sections 43-532 and 43-533, it is the intent of the Legislature
to strengthen the family and make the home, school, and community safe for
children by promoting responsible child care in all settings and to provide,
when necessary, a safe temporary or permanent home environment for abused
or neglected children.</para>
<para>(2) In addition,
it is the policy of this state to: Require the reporting of child abuse or
neglect in home, school, and community settings; provide for alternative response
to reports as permitted by rules and regulations of the department; provide
for traditional response to reports as required by rules and regulations of
the department; and provide protective and supportive services designed to
preserve and strengthen the family in appropriate cases.</para>
