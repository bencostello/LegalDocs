a license as a mortgage banker,
if the director finds that the character and general fitness of the applicant,
the members thereof if the applicant is a partnership, limited liability company,
association, or other organization, and the officers, directors, and principal
employees if the applicant is a corporation are such that the business will
be operated honestly, soundly, and efficiently in the public interest consistent
with the purposes of the Residential
Mortgage Licensing Act, the director shall issue a license as
a mortgage banker to the applicant. The director shall approve or deny an
application for a license within ninety days after (a) acceptance of the application;
(b) delivery of the bond required under section 45-724; and
(c) payment of the required fee.</para>
<para>(2) If the director determines that the mortgage banker license application should be denied, the director shall
notify the applicant in writing of the denial and of the reasons for the denial.
The director shall not deny an application for a mortgage banker license because of the failure
to submit information required under the act or rules and regulations adopted
and promulgated under the act without first giving the applicant an opportunity
to correct the deficiency by supplying the missing information. A decision
of the director denying a mortgage
banker license application pursuant
to the act may be appealed.
The appeal
shall be in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and rules and regulations adopted and promulgated by the
department under the act. The director may deny an application
for a mortgage banker license application if (a) he or she determines that the applicant
does not meet the conditions of subsection (1) of this section or (b) an
officer, director, shareholder owning five percent or more of the voting shares
of the applicant, partner, or member was convicted of, pleaded guilty to,
or was found guilty after a plea of nolo contendere to (i) a
misdemeanor under any state or federal law which involves dishonesty or fraud
or which involves any aspect of the mortgage banking business, depository institution business, or installment
loan company business
or (ii) any felony under state
or federal law.</para>
<para>(3)(a) All initial licenses shall remain in full force and effect until
the next succeeding December 31. Mortgage banker licenses
may be renewed annually by submitting
to the director a request for
renewal and any supplemental material as required
by the director. The mortgage banker licensee shall certify that the information
contained in the license application, as subsequently amended, that is on
file with the department and the information contained in any supplemental
material previously provided to the department remains true and correct.</para>
<para>(b) For the annual renewal of a license to conduct
a mortgage banking business under the Residential
Mortgage Licensing Act, the fee shall be two hundred dollars plus
seventy-five dollars for each branch office, if applicable, and any processing
fee allowed under subsection (2)
of section 45-748.</para>
<para>(4) The director may require
a mortgage banker licensee
to maintain a minimum net worth, proven by an audit conducted by a certified
public accountant, if the director determines that the financial condition
of the licensee warrants such a requirement or that the requirement is in
the public interest.</para>
