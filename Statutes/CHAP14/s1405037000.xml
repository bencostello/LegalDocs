The total cost of improvements shall be levied at one time upon the property and become delinquent as provided in this section. The city may require that the total amount of such assessment be paid in less than ten years if, in each year of the payment schedule, the maximum amount payable, excluding interest, is five hundred dollars. If the total amount is more than five thousand dollars, then it shall become delinquent as follows: One-tenth of the total amount shall be delinquent in fifty days after such levy; one-tenth in one year; one-tenth in two years; one-tenth in three years; one-tenth in four years; one-tenth in five years; one-tenth in six years; one-tenth in seven years; one-tenth in eight years; and one-tenth in nine years. Each of the installments except the first shall draw interest at a rate not to exceed the rate of interest specified in section 45-104.01, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted by the Legislature, from the time of levy until the same becomes delinquent and, after the same becomes delinquent, shall draw interest at the rate specified in section 45-104.01, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted by the Legislature, payable in advance, as in case of other special taxes. Such assessments shall be collected and enforced as in other cases of special assessments.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1921, c. 116, art.
