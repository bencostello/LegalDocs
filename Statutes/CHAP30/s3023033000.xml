Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce, dissolution, or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by testator's remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce, dissolution, or annulment means any divorce, dissolution, or annulment which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of section 30-2353. A decree of separation which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section. No change of circumstances other than as described in this section revokes a will.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 354, &#167; 55, UPC &#167; 2-508. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
