The amount of the bond may be fixed at the discretion of the court, but if not otherwise fixed by the court, the amount of the bond shall be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the personal property of the estate in his or her control plus one year's estimated income from all sources minus the value of securities deposited under arrangements requiring an order of the court for their removal. The court, in lieu of sureties on a bond, may accept other security for the performance of the bond, including a pledge of securities or a mortgage of land. The court may consider the desires of the protected person as expressed in any written power of attorney in determining whether a bond shall be required and the amount thereof.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 354, &#167; 258, UPC &#167; 5-411; </para><para>Laws 1985, LB 292, &#167; 4. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
