In particular, and without qualifying the foregoing, a guardian has the following powers and duties, except as may be specified by order of the court:</para><para>(1) To the extent that it is consistent with the terms of any order by a court of competent jurisdiction relating to detention or commitment of the ward, he or she is entitled to custody of the person of his or her ward and may establish the ward's place of abode within or without this state. When establishing the ward's place of abode, a guardian shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that the placement is the least restrictive alternative. A guardian shall authorize a placement to a more restrictive environment only after careful evaluation of the need for such placement. The guardian may obtain a professional evaluation or assessment that such placement is in the best interest of the ward.</para><para>(2) If entitled to custody of his or her ward, he or she shall make provision for the care, comfort, and maintenance of his or her ward and, whenever appropriate, arrange for his or her training and education. Without regard to custodial rights of the ward's person, he or she shall take reasonable care of his or her ward's clothing, furniture, vehicles, and other personal effects and commence protective proceedings if other property of his or her ward is in need of protection.</para><para>(3) A guardian may give any consents or approvals that may be necessary to enable the ward to receive medical, psychiatric, psychological, or other professional care, counsel, treatment, or service. When making such medical or psychiatric decisions, the guardian shall consider and carry out the intent of the ward expressed prior to incompetency to the extent allowable by law. Notwithstanding this provision or any other provision of the Nebraska Probate Code, the ward may authorize the release of financial, medical, and other confidential records pursuant to sections 20-161 to 20-166.</para><para>(4) If no conservator for the estate of the ward has been appointed, he or she may:</para><para>(i) Institute proceedings to compel any person under a duty to support the ward or to pay sums for the welfare of the ward to perform his or her duty;</para><para>(ii) Receive money and tangible property deliverable to the ward and apply the money and property for support, care, and education of the ward; but he or she may not use funds from his or her ward's estate for room and board which he or she, his or her spouse, parent, or child has furnished the ward unless a charge for the service is approved by order of the court made upon notice to at least one of the next of kin of the ward, if notice is possible. He or she must exercise care to conserve any excess for the ward's needs; and</para><para>(iii) Exercise a settlor's powers with respect to revocation, amendment, or distribution of trust property when authorized by a court acting under the authority of subsection (f) of section 30-3854. In acting under the authority of subsection (f) of section 30-3854, the court shall proceed in the same manner as provided under subdivision (3) of section 30-2637.</para><para>(5) A guardian is required to report the condition of his or her ward and of the estate which has been subject to his or her possession or control, at least every year and as required by the court or court rule. The court shall receive from any interested person, for a period of thirty days after the filing of the guardian's report, any comments with regard to the need for continued guardianship or amendment of the guardianship order. If the court has reason to believe that additional rights should be returned to the ward or assigned to the guardian, the court shall set a date for a hearing and may provide all protections as set forth for the original finding of incapacity and appointment of a guardian.</para><para>(6) If a conservator has been appointed, all of the ward's estate received by the guardian in excess of those funds expended to meet current expenses for support, care, and education of the ward must be paid to the conservator for management as provided in the Nebraska Probate Code, and the guardian must account to the conservator for funds expended.</para><para>(b) Any guardian of one for whom a conservator also has been appointed shall control the custody and care of the ward, and is entitled to receive reasonable sums for his or her services and for room and board furnished to the ward as agreed upon between him or her and the conservator, provided the amounts agreed upon are reasonable under the circumstances. The guardian may request the conservator to expend the ward's estate by payment to third persons or institutions for the ward's care and maintenance.</para><para>(c) Nothing in subdivision (a)(3) of this section or in any other part of this section shall be construed to alter the decisionmaking authority of an attorney in fact designated and authorized under sections 30-3401 to 30-3432 to make health care decisions pursuant to a power of attorney for health care.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1974, LB 354, &#167; 246, UPC &#167; 5-312; </para><para>Laws 1982, LB 428, &#167; 11; </para><para>Laws 1993, LB 782, &#167; 11; </para><para>Laws 1997, LB 466, &#167; 11; </para><para>Laws 2003, LB 130, &#167; 130. </para></source><annotation><para>Placing the establishment of a visitation schedule in the guardian is anticipated by the statutory duties assigned to a guardian with full powers.
