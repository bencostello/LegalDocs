If the exercise of the power of attorney requires execution and delivery of any instrument that is recordable, the affidavit when authenticated for record is likewise recordable. This section shall not affect any provision in a power of attorney for its termination by expiration of time or occurrence of an event other than express revocation or a change in the principal's capacity.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1985, LB 292, &#167; 10. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
