The electors whose names are so drawn shall be summoned by the sheriff to forthwith appear before the court, and, after having been examined, such as are found competent and shall have no lawful excuse for not serving as jurors shall constitute a special venire from which the court shall proceed to have a jury impaneled for the trial of the cause. The court may repeat the exercise of this power until all the parties charged in the same indictment or information shall have been tried.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1881, c. 34, &#167; 1, p. 213; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 9106; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 10131; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 29-2003; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 29-2003.</para></source><annotation><para>If several juries are picked at one time from a single jury panel for a series of trials, examination must be allowed if requested for good reason in subsequent trials in the series to determine if any jurors should be excused for cause.
