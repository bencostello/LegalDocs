<para>(1) Except when a term of life imprisonment is required by law, in imposing
an indeterminate sentence upon an offender the court shall:</para>
<para>(a)(i) Until July 1, 1998, fix the minimum and maximum limits of the
sentence to be served within the limits provided by law, except that when
a maximum limit of life is imposed by the court for a Class IB felony, the
minimum limit may be any term of years not less than the statutory mandatory
minimum; and</para>
<para>(ii) Beginning July 1, 1998:</para>
<para>(A) Fix the minimum and maximum limits of the sentence to be served
within the limits provided by law for any class of felony other than a Class
IV felony, except that when a maximum limit of life is imposed by the court
for a Class IB felony, the minimum limit may be any term of years not less
than the statutory mandatory minimum. If the criminal offense is a Class IV
felony, the court shall fix the minimum and maximum limits of the sentence,
but the minimum limit fixed by the court shall not be less than the minimum
provided by law nor more than one-third of the maximum term and the maximum
limit shall not be greater than the maximum provided by law; or</para>
<para>(B) Impose a definite term of years, in which event the maximum term
of the sentence shall be the term imposed by the court and the minimum term
shall be the minimum sentence provided by law;</para>
<para>(b) Advise the offender on the record the time the offender will serve
on his or her minimum term before attaining parole eligibility assuming that
no good time for which the offender will be eligible is lost; and</para>
<para>(c) Advise the offender on the record the time the offender will serve
on his or her maximum term before attaining mandatory release assuming that
no good time for which the offender will be eligible is lost.</para>
<para>If any discrepancy exists between the statement of the minimum limit
of the sentence and the statement of parole eligibility or between the statement
of the maximum limit of the sentence and the statement of mandatory release,
the statements of the minimum limit and the maximum limit shall control the
calculation of the offender's term. If the court imposes more than one sentence
upon an offender or imposes a sentence upon an offender who is at that time
serving another sentence, the court shall state whether the sentences are
to be concurrent or consecutive.</para>
<para>(2)(a) When the court is of the opinion that imprisonment may be appropriate
but desires more detailed information as a basis for determining the sentence
to be imposed than has been provided by the presentence report required by
section 29-2261, the court shall commit an offender to the Department of Correctional
Services for a period not exceeding ninety days. The department shall conduct
a complete study of the offender during that time, inquiring into such matters
as his or her previous delinquency or criminal experience, social background,
capabilities, and mental, emotional, and physical health and the rehabilitative
resources or programs which may be available to suit his or her needs. By
the expiration of the period of commitment or by the expiration of such additional
time as the court shall grant, not exceeding a further period of ninety days,
the offender shall be returned to the court for sentencing and the court shall
be provided with a written report of the results of the study, including whatever
recommendations the department believes will be helpful to a proper resolution
of the case. After receiving the report and the recommendations, the court
shall proceed to sentence the offender in accordance with subsection (1) of
this section. The term of the sentence shall run from the date of original
commitment under this subsection.</para>
<para>(b) In order to encourage the use of this procedure in appropriate cases,
all costs incurred during the period the defendant is held in a state institution
under this subsection shall be a responsibility of the state and the county
shall be liable only for the cost of delivering the defendant to the institution
and the cost of returning him or her to the appropriate court for sentencing
or such other disposition as the court may then deem appropriate.</para>
<para>(3) Except when a term of life is required by law, whenever the defendant
was under eighteen years of age at the time he or she committed the crime
for which he or she was convicted, the court may, in its discretion, instead
of imposing the penalty provided for the crime, make such disposition of the
defendant as the court deems proper under the Nebraska Juvenile Code. Prior
to making a disposition which commits the juvenile to the Office of Juvenile
Services, the court shall order the juvenile to be evaluated by the office
if the juvenile has not had an evaluation within the past twelve months.</para>

App. 280, 594 N.W.2d 303 (1999).</para><para>The statement of minimum sentence controls calculation of offender's term and a misstatement of parole eligibility cannot be used to "bootstrap" a reduced term of sentence.

While this section does not require that a minimum term be different from a maximum term, it does require that a minimum term be affirmatively stated if it is to be imposed, and if a minimum term is not set forth, an indeterminate sentence will be imposed by operation of law.

App. 496, 560 N.W.2d 189 (1997).</para><para>Pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section, in setting an indeterminate sentence, there must be a difference between the periods, and a sentence fixing identical minimum and maximum terms of imprisonment is not an indeterminate sentence. There is nothing in subsection (1)(a) of this section mandating that an indeterminate sentence must be imposed, nor is there a requirement that the minimum and maximum terms of such a sentence differ by any specific span of time.
