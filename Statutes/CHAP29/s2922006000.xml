have now or may hereafter have the power to punish offenses, either in whole
or in part, by requiring the offender to pay fines or
costs, or both, such courts or magistrates may make it a part of the sentence
that the party stand committed and be imprisoned in the jail of the proper
county until the fines or costs are paid or
secured to be paid or the offender is otherwise discharged
according to law.</para>
<para>(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, when any offender
demonstrates to the court or magistrate that he or she is unable to pay such fines or costs in one lump sum, the court or
magistrate shall make arrangements suitable to the court or magistrate and
to the offender by which the offender may pay in installments. The court or
magistrate shall enter an order specifying the terms of such arrangements
and the dates on which payments are to be made. When the judgment of conviction
provides for the suspension or revocation of a motor vehicle operator's license
and the court authorizes the payment of fines or
costs by installments, the revocation or suspension shall be effective as
of the date of judgment.</para>
<para>(3) As an alternative
to a lump-sum payment or as an alternative or in conjunction with installment
payments, the court or magistrate may deduct fines or costs from a bond posted
by the offender to the extent that such bond is not otherwise encumbered by
a valid lien, levy, execution, or assignment to counsel of record or the person
who posted the bond.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>G.S.1873, c. 58, &#167; 500, p. 833; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 9142; </para><para>C.S.1922, &#167; 10167; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 29-2207; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 29-2206; </para><para>Laws 1971, LB 1010, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1974, LB 966, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1979, LB 111, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1988, LB 370, &#167; 6; </para><para>Laws 2012, LB722, &#167; 1.</para><effectivedate>July 19, 2012</effectivedate></source><crossreference><para><emphasis>Imprisonment at hard labor,</emphasis> see sections 29-2208, 29-2405, 29-2414, and 29-2415.</para></crossreference><annotation><para>The court cannot require that a fine be satisfied by applying jail time served without giving the defendant an opportunity to pay the fine.
