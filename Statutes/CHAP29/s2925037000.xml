review.</catchline><para>(1) If any convicted person under sentence
of death shall appear to be incompetent,
the Director
of Correctional Services shall forthwith give notice thereof to
a judge of the district court of the judicial district in which the convicted person was tried and sentenced and
such judge shall at once make such investigation as shall satisfy him or her
as to whether a commission ought to be named to examine such convicted
person.</para>
<para>(2) If the court determines that
there is not sufficient reason for the appointment of a commission, the court shall so find and refuse to suspend
the execution of the convicted person. If the court determines that a commission
ought to be appointed to examine such convicted
person, the court shall make a finding to that effect and cause
it to be entered upon the records of the district court in the county in which
such convicted person was sentenced,
and, if necessary, the court shall suspend the execution
and appoint three licensed mental health professionals
employed by the state as a commission to examine such convicted person. The commission shall examine
the convicted person to determine
whether he or she is competent
or incompetent
and shall report its findings in writing to the court within
ten days after its appointment. If two members of
the commission find
the convicted person incompetent,
the court shall suspend the convicted person's execution until further
order. Thereafter,
the court shall appoint a commission annually to review the convicted person's
competency. The results of such review shall be provided to the court. If
the convicted person is subsequently found to be competent by two members
of the commission, the court shall certify that finding to the Supreme Court
which shall then establish a date for the enforcement of the convicted person's
sentence.</para>
<para>(3) The standard
for the determination of competency under this section shall be the same as
the standard for determining competency to stand trial.</para>
