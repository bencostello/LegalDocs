<para>(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection
(2) of this section, a registered voter of this state who anticipates
being absent from the county of his or her residence on the day of any election
may appear in person before the election commissioner or county clerk not
more than thirty days prior to the day of election and obtain his or her ballot.
The registered voter shall vote in the office of the election commissioner
or county clerk or shall return the ballot to the office not later than the
closing of the polls on the day of the election. A registered voter who is
present in the county on the day of the election and who chooses to vote on
the day of the election shall vote at the polling place assigned to the precinct
in which he or she resides unless he or she is returning a ballot for early
voting or voting pursuant to section 32-943.</para>
<para>(2) If a person registers
to vote and requests a ballot at the same time, he or she shall vote a ballot
which is placed in an envelope with the voter's name and address and other
necessary identifying information and kept securely for counting as provided
in this subsection. This subsection does not extend the deadline for voter
registration specified in section 32-302. A ballot cast pursuant to this subsection
shall be rejected and shall not be counted if the acknowledgment of registration
sent to the registrant pursuant to section 32-322 is returned as undeliverable
for a reason other than clerical error within ten days after it is mailed,
otherwise after such ten-day period, the ballot shall be counted.</para>
