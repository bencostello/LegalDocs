of the school board of a Class II school district shall be elected at the
statewide general election. The school board of a Class II school district
shall have no fewer than five members and no more than nine members as provided
in section 79-550. The number of members to be elected at the statewide general
election and the terms for which they will be elected shall be determined
by the election commissioner or county clerk with the aid of the secretary
