The Nebraska Arts and Humanities Cash Fund is created. The fund shall consist
of all funds credited from the Nebraska Cultural Preservation Endowment Fund
pursuant to section 82-331. The Nebraska Arts Council shall administer and
distribute the Nebraska Arts and Humanities Cash Fund. All disbursements from
the Nebraska Arts and Humanities Cash Fund shall be matched dollar-for-dollar
by sources other than state funds. The match funds shall be new money generated
for endowments established by the Nebraska Arts Council or Nebraska Humanities
Council or qualified endowments of their constituent organizations, new money
generated as a result of seed grants to recipients, or new money generated
by the Nebraska Arts Council or Nebraska Humanities Council for arts or humanities
education. Matching
funds shall also include earnings generated by qualified private endowments
formed in accordance with this section. New money used as a match
shall not be limited to matching the Nebraska Arts and Humanities Cash Fund
in the state fiscal year the new money is received, but it shall be used as
a match no later than the subsequent fiscal year. For an endowment to be a
qualified endowment (a) the endowment must meet the standards set by the Nebraska
Arts Council or Nebraska Humanities Council, (b) the endowment must be intended
for long-term stabilization of the organization, and (c) the funds of the
endowment must be endowed and only the earnings thereon expended. An organization
is a constituent organization if it receives funding from the Nebraska Arts
Council or Nebraska Humanities Council and is tax exempt under section 501
of the Internal Revenue Code. The match funds required by this section shall
not include in-kind contributions. The budget division of the Department of
Administrative Services shall approve allotment and disbursement of funds
from the Nebraska Arts and Humanities Cash Fund only to the extent the Nebraska
Arts Council has provided documentation of the dollar-for-dollar match required
by this section. Funds from the Nebraska Arts and Humanities Cash Fund may
be used for the purpose of obtaining challenge grants from the National Endowment
for the Humanities or the National Endowment for the Arts.</para>
<para>(2) Rules and regulations of the Nebraska Arts Council shall
provide that the ultimate use of disbursements from the Nebraska Arts and
Humanities Cash Fund shall be in a ratio of seventy percent to projects, endowments,
or programs designated by the Nebraska Arts Council and thirty percent to
projects, endowments, or programs designated by the Nebraska Humanities Council.</para>
<para>(3) Any money in the fund available for investment shall be
invested by the state investment officer pursuant to the Nebraska Capital
Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds Investment Act.</para>
