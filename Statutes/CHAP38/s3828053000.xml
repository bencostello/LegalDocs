Such temporary license shall be issued for a period of one year from the date of issuance and may be renewed each year thereafter for four additional years, and if the person so licensed has not become a citizen of the United States within five years of the date such temporary license was issued, such license shall terminate and the person so licensed shall have no further right to practice pharmacy in this state. If a temporary pharmacist licensee becomes a citizen of the United States while a temporary pharmacist license is in force and provides evidence thereof to the department, a pharmacist license may be issued in place of such temporary license and no additional fee shall be charged unless such temporary license had already expired, in which case a renewal fee shall be charged. The applicant for a temporary pharmacist license shall submit proof of his or her eligibility and intent to become a citizen of the United States. The fees to be paid and procedures for the denial, suspension, revocation, or reinstatement of such temporary license shall be the same as for a pharmacist license.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1973, LB 515, &#167; 6; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 1044, &#167; 450; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1996), &#167; 71-1,145.01; </para><para>Laws 2001, LB 398, &#167; 31; </para><para>R.S.1943, (2003), &#167; 71-1,143.02; </para><para>Laws 2007, LB463, &#167; 949.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
