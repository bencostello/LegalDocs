<para>The county
attorney or city attorney, in making
the determination whether to file a criminal charge, file a juvenile court
petition, offer juvenile pretrial diversion or mediation, or transfer a case to or from juvenile
court, and the juvenile court, county court, or district court in making the
determination whether to transfer a case, shall consider: (1)
The type of treatment such juvenile would most likely be amenable to; (2)
whether there is evidence that the alleged offense included violence; (3)
the motivation for the commission of the offense; (4) the age of the juvenile
and the ages and circumstances of any others involved in the offense; (5)
the previous history of the juvenile, including whether he or she had been
convicted of any previous offenses or adjudicated in juvenile court; (6) the best interests of the juvenile;
(7) consideration of public safety; (8) consideration of the juvenile's ability
to appreciate the nature and seriousness of his or her conduct; (9) whether
the best interests of the juvenile and the security of the public may require
that the juvenile continue in secure detention or under supervision for a
period extending beyond his or her minority and, if so, the available alternatives
best suited to this purpose; (10) whether the victim agrees
to participate in mediation; (11) whether there is a juvenile
pretrial diversion program established pursuant to sections 43-260.02 to 43-260.07; (12) whether the juvenile has been convicted
of or has acknowledged unauthorized use or possession of a firearm; (13) whether a juvenile court order has been
issued for the juvenile pursuant to section 43-2,106.03; (14) whether
the juvenile is a criminal street gang member; and (15) such
other matters as the parties deem relevant to aid in the decision.</para>

State v. Goodwin, 278 Neb. 945, 774 N.W.2d 733 (2009).</para><para>In deciding whether to transfer adult criminal proceedings to juvenile court, the court having jurisdiction must carefully consider the criteria set forth in this section. In weighing the criteria set forth in this section, there is no arithmetical computation or formula required in the court's consideration of the statutory criteria. In order to retain jurisdiction pursuant to section 29-1816, the district court does not need to resolve every factor in this section against the juvenile. State v. McCracken, 260 Neb. 234, 615 N.W.2d 902 (2000).</para><para>In weighing the factors set forth in this section, there is no arithmetical computation or formula required in the court's consideration of the statutory criteria. In order to retain the proceedings, the court need not resolve every factor against the juvenile. There are no weighted factors and no prescribed method by which more or less weight is assigned to each specific factor. It is a balancing test by which public protection and societal security are weighed against the practical and nonproblematical rehabilitation of the juvenile. State v. Mantich, 249 Neb. 311, 543 N.W.2d 181 (1996).</para><para>In deciding whether to transfer adult criminal proceedings to juvenile court, the court having jurisdiction over a pending criminal prosecution must carefully consider the criteria set forth in this section. State v. Reynolds, 247 Neb. 608, 529 N.W.2d 64 (1995).</para><para>Where 16-year-old defendant was charged with violent adult crimes, was an obvious threat to the public, and, if convicted, could not easily be rehabilitated in the juvenile correctional system or properly punished for the atrocities he would be adjudged to have committed, no abuse of discretion occurred in denial of transfer to juvenile court. State v. Garza, 241 Neb. 934, 492 N.W.2d 32 (1992).</para><para>The court having jurisdiction over a pending criminal prosecution of a juvenile must consider the juvenile's request for waiver to transfer the proceedings to the juvenile court in light of the criteria set forth in this section. State v. Doyle, 237 Neb. 944, 468 N.W.2d 594 (1991).</para><para>The factors set forth in this section provide a balancing test by which the protection of the public is weighed against the practical and not problematical rehabilitation of the juvenile. For retention of the criminal proceedings, the court need not resolve every factor against the juvenile. The standard of review applicable to an appeal from denial of a motion to transfer to juvenile court is abuse of discretion. State v. Phinney, 236 Neb. 76, 459 N.W.2d 200 (1990).</para><para>In deciding whether to grant a requested waiver of jurisdiction and transfer proceedings to juvenile court pursuant to section 29-1816, the court having jurisdiction over a pending criminal prosecution must carefully consider the juvenile's request in light of the criteria set forth in this section. State v. Nevels, 235 Neb. 39, 453 N.W.2d 579 (1990).</para><para>This section and section 29-1816 provide a balancing test in which public protection and security are weighed against practical, and not problematical, rehabilitation in determining whether there should be a waiver of jurisdiction over a criminal proceeding to the juvenile court. State v. Trevino, 230 Neb. 494, 432 N.W.2d 503 (1988).</para><para>This section and section 29-1816 involve a balancing test, namely, public protection and societal security weighed against practical and not problematic rehabilitation, in determining whether there should be a waiver of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings with a transfer to the juvenile court. Where the record supported the trial court's findings that the crime was violent, that the defendant may require treatment beyond the age of majority, that defendant's rehabilitative needs were beyond the scope of the juvenile court, and that more protection of the public was required than would be available in juvenile court, the district court did not abuse its discretion in retaining jurisdiction.
