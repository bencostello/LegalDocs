<para>Within three
months after April 12, 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services,
with direction from the Nebraska Children's Commission, shall contract with
an independent entity specializing in medicaid analysis to conduct a cross-system
analysis of current prevention and intervention programs and services provided
by the department for the safety, health, and well-being of children and funding
sources to (1) identify state General Funds being used, in order to better
utilize federal funds, (2) identify resources that could be better allocated
to more effective services to at-risk children and juveniles transitioning
to home-based and school-based interventions, and (3) provide information
which will allow the replacement of state General Funds for services to at-risk
children and juveniles with federal funds, with the goal of expanding the
funding base for such services while reducing overall state General Fund expenditures
on such services.</para>
