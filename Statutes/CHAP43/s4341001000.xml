access to services in the community for juveniles placed on probation, (2)
prevent unnecessary commitment of juveniles to the Department of Health and
Human Services and to the Office of Juvenile Services, (3) eliminate barriers
preventing juveniles from receiving needed services, (4) prevent unnecessary
penetration of juveniles further into the juvenile justice system, (5) enable
the juvenile's needs to be met in the least intrusive and least restrictive
manner while maintaining the safety of the juvenile and the community, (6)
reduce the duplication of resources within the juvenile justice system through
intense coordinated case management and supervision, and (7) use evidence-based
practices and responsive case management to improve outcomes for adjudicated
juveniles.</para>
