<para>(1) Within
forty-five days after the voluntary services and support agreement is signed,
the department shall file with the juvenile court a written report or petition
describing the young adult's current situation, including the young adult's
name, date of birth, and current address and the reasons why it is in the
young adult's best interests to receive extended services and support. The
department shall also provide the juvenile court with a copy of the signed
voluntary services and support agreement, a copy of the case plan, and any
other information the department or the young adult wants the court to consider.</para>
<para>(2) To ensure
continuity of care and eligibility, the voluntary services and support agreement
should be signed prior to and filed with the court at the last court hearing
before the young adult is discharged from foster care for all young adults
who choose to participate in the extended services program at that time.</para>
<para>(3) The court
has the jurisdiction to review the voluntary services and support agreement
signed by the department and the young adult under section 43-4506. Upon the
filing of a report or petition under subsection (1) of this section, the court
shall open an extended services and support file for the young adult for the
purpose of determining whether continuing in extended services and support
is in the young adult's best interests and for the purpose of conducting permanency
reviews as described in subsection (5) of this section.</para>
<para>(4) The court
shall make the best interests determination as described in subsection (3)
of this section not later than one hundred eighty days after the young adult
and the department enter into the voluntary services and support agreement.</para>
<para>(5) The court
shall conduct a hearing for permanency review consistent with 42 U.S.C. 675(5)(C)
as described in subsection (6) of this section regarding the voluntary services
and support agreement at least once per year and at additional times at the
request of the young adult, the department, or any other party to the proceeding.
The juvenile court may request the appointment of a hearing officer pursuant
to section 24-230 to conduct permanency review hearings. The department is
not required to have legal counsel present at such hearings.</para>
<para>(6) The primary
purpose of the permanency review is to ensure that the young adult is getting
the needed services and support to help the young adult move toward permanency
and self-sufficiency. This shall include the procedural safeguards described
in 42 U.S.C. 675(5)(C), including that, in all permanency reviews or hearings
regarding the transition of the young adult from foster care to independent
living, the court shall consult, in an age-appropriate manner, with the young
adult regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan for the young adult
and any other procedural safeguards that apply to children under nineteen
years of age under existing state law. The young adult shall have a clear
self-advocacy role in the permanency review in accordance with section 43-4510,
and the hearing shall support the active engagement of the young adult in
key decisions. Permanency reviews shall be conducted in an informal manner
and, whenever possible, outside of the courtroom.</para></amendatorysection>
