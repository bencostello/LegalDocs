The limitations may include, but are not limited to:</para>

considered a report for purposes of inclusion in the central registry of
child protection cases pursuant to the Child Protection and Family Safety Act.</para>
<para>(3) If a parent is found to have engaged in any activity
specified in subsection (1) of this section, the court shall not order legal
or physical custody to be given to that parent without making special written
findings that the child and other parent can be adequately protected from
harm by such limits as it may impose under such subsection. The parent found
to have engaged in the behavior specified in subsection (1) of this section
has the burden of proving that legal or physical custody, parenting time,
visitation, or other access to that parent will not endanger the child or
the other parent.</para>
