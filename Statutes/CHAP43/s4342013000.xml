additional stipend; payment; administrative fee.</catchline><para>In
recognition of Nebraska foster parents' essential contribution to the safety
and well-being of Nebraska's foster children and the need for additional compensation
for the services provided by Nebraska foster parents,  beginning July 1, 2012, through June 30, 2014, all
foster parents providing foster care in Nebraska, including traditional, agency-based,
licensed, approved, relative placement, and child-specific foster care, shall
receive an additional stipend of three dollars and ten cents per day per child.
The stipend shall be in addition to the current foster care reimbursement
rates for relatives and foster parents contracting with the Department of
Health and Human Services and in addition to the relative and tiered rate
paid to a contractor for agency-based foster parents. The additional stipend
shall be paid monthly through the agency that is contracting with the foster
parent or, in the case of a foster parent contracting with the department,
directly from the department. The contracting agency shall receive an administrative
fee of twenty-five cents per child per day for processing the payments for
the benefit of the foster parents and the state, which administrative fee
shall be paid monthly by the state. The administrative fee shall not reduce
the stipend of three dollars and ten cents provided by this section.</para>
