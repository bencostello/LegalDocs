Such notice shall be provided to all of the following that are applicable to the case: (1) The person charged with the care of such child; (2) the child's parents or guardian unless the parental rights of the parents have been terminated by court action as provided in section 43-292 or 43-297; (3) the foster child if age fourteen or over; (4) the foster parent or parents of the foster child; (5) the guardian ad litem of the foster child; (6) the state board; (7) the preadoptive parent; and (8) the relative providing care for the child.
