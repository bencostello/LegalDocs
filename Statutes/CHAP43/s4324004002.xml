created; use; reports.</catchline><para>(1) There is created a
separate and distinct budgetary program within the commission to be known
as the Community-based Juvenile Services
Aid Program. Funding acquired from participation in the federal act, state
General Funds, and funding acquired from other sources which may be used for
purposes consistent with the Juvenile Services Act and the federal act shall
be used to aid in
the establishment and provision of community-based services for juveniles who come in contact with the
juvenile justice system.</para>
<para>(2) The annual General Fund appropriation to the Community-based Juvenile Services Aid Program
shall be apportioned as aid in accordance with a formula established in rules
and regulations adopted and promulgated by the commission. The formula shall
be based on the total number of residents per county and federally recognized or state-recognized Indian tribe who
are twelve years of age through eighteen years of age and other relevant factors
as determined by the commission. The commission may require a local match
of up to forty percent from the county, multiple counties, federally
recognized or state-recognized Indian tribe or tribes, or any combination
of the three which is receiving aid under such program. Any local
expenditures for community-based programs for juveniles may be applied toward
such match requirement.</para>
<para>(3) Funds provided under the Community-based Juvenile Services
Aid Program shall be used exclusively to assist the
aid recipient in the implementation
and operation of programs or the
provision of services identified in the
aid recipient's comprehensive juvenile services plan, including programs
for local
planning and service coordination; screening, assessment, and evaluation;
diversion; alternatives to detention; family support services; treatment services;
reentry services; truancy prevention and intervention programs; and other
services that will positively impact juveniles and families in the juvenile
justice system. In distributing funds provided under the Community-based Juvenile Services Aid Program, aid recipients shall prioritize programs and
services that will divert
juveniles from the juvenile justice system, reduce the population of juveniles
in juvenile detention and secure confinement, and assist in transitioning
juveniles from out-of-home placements. No funds appropriated or
distributed under the Community-based Juvenile Services
Aid Program shall be used for construction of secure detention facilities,
secure youth treatment facilities, or secure youth confinement facilities.
Aid received under this section shall not be used for capital construction
or the lease or acquisition of facilities except
for additional probation offices associated with carrying out the expanded
probation duties in Laws 2013, LB561, and shall not be used to
replace existing funding for programs or services. Any funds not distributed
to counties under this subsection shall be retained by the commission to be
distributed on a competitive basis under the Community-based Juvenile
Services Aid Program for a
county, multiple counties, federally recognized or state-recognized Indian
tribes, or any combination of the three demonstrating additional need in the
funding areas identified in this subsection.</para>
<para>(4) Any recipient
of funding under the Community-based Juvenile Services
Aid Program shall file an annual report as required by rules and regulations
adopted and promulgated by the commission. The report shall include, but not
be limited to, the type of
juvenile service, how the service met the goals of the comprehensive juvenile
services plan, demographic information on the total number of
juveniles served, program
success rates, the total number of juveniles sent to secure juvenile detention
or residential treatment and secure confinement, and a listing
of the expenditures
for detention, residential treatment, and nonresidential treatment.</para>
<para>(5) The commission shall report annually to the Governor
and the Legislature on the distribution and use of funds appropriated under
the Community-based Juvenile Services
Aid Program. The report shall

Juvenile Services Aid Program funds, including the types of juvenile services
and programs that were funded, demographic information on the total number
of juveniles served, program success rates, the total number of juveniles
sent to secure juvenile detention or residential treatment and secure confinement,
and a listing of the expenditures of all counties and federally recognized
or state-recognized Indian tribes for detention, residential treatment, and
secure confinement. The report submitted to the Legislature shall
be submitted electronically.</para>

Aid Program in consultation with the Director of the Community-based Juvenile
Services Aid Program, the Director of Juvenile Diversion Programs, the Office
of Probation Administration, the Nebraska Association of County Officials,
and the University of Nebraska at Omaha, Juvenile Justice Institute. The rules
