When making a determination regarding significant risk to the child, the prima facie evidence shall constitute a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence. However, this presumption shall not apply if there are factors mitigating against its application, including whether the other party seeking custody, parenting time, visitation, or other access is also required, as the result of a felony conviction in which the victim was a minor, to register as a sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration Act.</para><para>(2) No person shall be granted custody, parenting time, visitation, or other access with a child if the person has been convicted under section 28-319 and the child was conceived as a result of that violation.</para><para>(3) A change in circumstances relating to subsection (1) or (2) of this section is sufficient grounds for modification of a previous order.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2007, LB554, &#167; 14. </para></source><crossreference><para><emphasis>Sex Offender Registration Act,</emphasis> see section 29-4001.</para></crossreference><annotation><para>Taken together, subdivision (1)(b) and subsection (3) of this section create a statutory presumption against custody being awarded to a person residing with a person required to register under the Sex Offender Registration Act due to a felony conviction in which the victim was a minor or as a result of an offense that would make it contrary to the best interests of the child whose custody is at issue, but this presumption can be overcome by evidence.
