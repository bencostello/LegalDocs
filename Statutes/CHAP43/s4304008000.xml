Services; committing court; determination of placement and treatment services;

This subsection applies to all juveniles committed to the Office of Juvenile
Services for placement at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center prior
to July 1, 2013, and to all juveniles committed to the Office of Juvenile
Services for community supervision prior to October 1, 2013. Whenever
any juvenile is committed to the Office of Juvenile Services, to any
facility operated by the Office of Juvenile Services, or to the custody of
the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Services, a superintendent of
a facility, or an administrator of a program, the juvenile is deemed committed
to the Office of Juvenile Services. Juveniles committed to the Office of Juvenile
Services shall also be considered committed to the care and custody of the
Department of Health and Human Services for the purpose of obtaining health
care and treatment services.</para>
<para>(b) The committing court shall
order the initial level of treatment for a juvenile committed to the Office
of Juvenile Services. Prior to determining the initial level of treatment
for a juvenile, the court may solicit a recommendation regarding the initial
level of treatment from the Office of Juvenile Services. Under this subsection, the committing court shall not order
a specific placement for a juvenile. The court shall continue to maintain
jurisdiction over any juvenile committed to the Office of Juvenile Services
until such time that the juvenile is discharged from the Office of Juvenile
Services. The court shall conduct review hearings every six months, or at
the request of the juvenile, for any juvenile committed to the Office of Juvenile
Services who is placed outside his or her home, except for a juvenile residing
at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center. The court shall determine
whether an out-of-home placement made by the Office of Juvenile Services is
in the best interests of the juvenile, with due consideration being given
by the court to public safety. If the court determines that the out-of-home
placement is not in the best interests of the juvenile, the court may order
other treatment services for the juvenile.</para>
<para>(c) After the initial level
of treatment is ordered by the committing court, the Office of Juvenile Services
shall provide treatment services which conform to the court's level of treatment
determination. Within thirty days after making an actual placement, the Office
of Juvenile Services shall provide the committing court with written notification
of where the juvenile has been placed. At least once every six months thereafter,
until the juvenile is discharged from the care and custody of the Office of
Juvenile Services, the office shall provide the committing court with written
notification of the juvenile's actual placement and the level of treatment
that the juvenile is receiving.</para>
<para>(d) For transfer hearings,
the burden of proof to justify the transfer is on the Office of Juvenile Services,
the standard of proof is clear and convincing evidence, and the strict rules
of evidence do not apply. Transfers of juveniles from one place of treatment
to another are subject to section 43-251.01 and to the following:</para>
<para>(i) Except as provided in
subdivision (d)(ii) of this subsection,
if the Office of Juvenile Services proposes to transfer the juvenile from
a less restrictive to a more restrictive place of treatment, a plan outlining
the proposed change and the reasons for the proposed change shall be presented
to the court which committed the juvenile. Such change shall occur only after
a hearing and a finding by the committing court that the change is in the
best interests of the juvenile, with due consideration being given by the
court to public safety. At the hearing, the juvenile has the right to be represented
by counsel;</para>
<para>(ii) The Office of Juvenile
Services may make an immediate temporary change without prior approval by
the committing court only if the juvenile is in a harmful or dangerous situation,
is suffering a medical emergency, is exhibiting behavior which warrants temporary
removal, or has been placed in a non-state-owned facility and such facility
has requested that the juvenile be removed. Approval of the committing court
shall be sought within fifteen days of making an immediate temporary change,
at which time a hearing shall occur before the court. The court shall determine
whether it is in the best interests of the juvenile to remain in the new place
of treatment, with due consideration being given by the court to public safety.
At the hearing, the juvenile has the right to be represented by counsel; and</para>
<para>(iii) If the proposed change
seeks to transfer the juvenile from a more restrictive to a less restrictive
place of treatment or to transfer the juvenile from the juvenile's current
place of treatment to another which has the same level of restriction as the
current place of treatment, the Office of Juvenile Services shall notify the
juvenile, the juvenile's parents, custodian, or legal guardian, the committing
court, the county attorney, the counsel for the juvenile, and the guardian
ad litem of the proposed change. The juvenile has fifteen days after the date
of the notice to request an administrative hearing with the Office of Juvenile
Services, at which time the Office of Juvenile Services shall determine whether
it is in the best interests of the juvenile for the proposed change to occur,
with due consideration being given by the office to public safety. The juvenile
may be represented by counsel at the juvenile's own expense. If the juvenile
is aggrieved by the administrative decision of the Office of Juvenile Services,
the juvenile may appeal that decision to the committing court within fifteen
days after the Office of Juvenile Services' decision. At the hearing before
the committing court, the juvenile has the right to be represented by counsel.</para>
<para>(e) If a juvenile is placed
in detention after the initial level of treatment is determined by the committing
court, the committing court shall hold a hearing every fourteen days to review
the status of the juvenile. Placement of a juvenile in detention shall not
be considered as a treatment service.</para>
<para>(f) The committing court's
review of a change of place of treatment pursuant to this subsection does
not apply to parole revocation hearings.</para>
<para>(2)(a) This
subsection applies to all juveniles committed to the Office of Juvenile Services
for placement at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center on or after July
1, 2013. Whenever any juvenile is committed to the Office of Juvenile Services,
the juvenile shall also be considered committed to the care and custody of
the Department of Health and Human Services for the purpose of obtaining health
care and treatment services.</para><para>(b) The committing court shall order placement
at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center for a juvenile committed to
the Office of Juvenile Services. The court shall continue to maintain jurisdiction
over any juvenile committed to the Office of Juvenile Services for the purpose
of reviewing the juvenile's probation upon discharge from the care and custody
of the Office of Juvenile Services.</para><para>(c) If a juvenile is placed in detention
while awaiting placement at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center and
the placement has not occurred within fourteen days, the committing court
shall hold a hearing every fourteen days to review the status of the juvenile.
Placement of a juvenile in detention shall not be considered a treatment service.</para>

<para>Under subsection (2) of this section and section 43-247, a juvenile court has jurisdiction over an adjudicated juvenile whom the court has placed at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center. But despite that jurisdiction, subsection (2) of this section prohibits a juvenile court from reviewing the progress of a juvenile whom the court has placed at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center. In re Interest of Trey H., 281 Neb. 760, 798 N.W.2d 607 (2011).</para>
<para>When a court adjudicates a juvenile under section 43-247(2) and (3) and commits the juvenile to the Office of Juvenile Services with a placement at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center, it has determined that the subsection (2) adjudication will control the juvenile's disposition. The disposition determination controls which review hearing statute applies, and the requirement in section 43-278 for 6-month review hearings does not authorize the court to conduct review hearings. Instead, the prohibition in subsection (2) of this section of review hearings for juveniles placed at a youth rehabilitation and treatment center controls. In re Interest of Trey H., 281 Neb. 760, 798 N.W.2d 607 (2011).</para>
<para>Giving effect to the language of this section, while the Office of Juvenile Services may make an initial determination with regard to the advisability of the discharge of a juvenile committed to that office, the committing court, as a result of its statutorily imposed continuing jurisdiction, must approve the discharge of the juvenile. In re Interest of Tamantha S., 267 Neb. 78, 672 N.W.2d 24 (2003).</para><para>A juvenile court does not have the authority to enter an order prohibiting any change without prior court approval in the placement of a juvenile committed to the custody of the Office of Juvenile Services. In re Interest of Chelsey D., 14 Neb. App. 392, 707 N.W.2d 798 (2005).</para></annotation>  </law>
