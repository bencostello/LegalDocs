with the needs of the protected juvenile which (i) shall include consultation
with the juvenile within two weeks after the appointment and once every six
months thereafter and inquiry of the most current caseworker, foster parent,
or other custodian and (ii) may include inquiry of others directly involved
with the juvenile or who may have information or knowledge about the circumstances
which brought the juvenile court action or related cases and the development
of the juvenile, including biological parents, physicians, psychologists,
teachers, and clergy members;</para>
<para>(e) May present evidence and witnesses and cross-examine
witnesses at all evidentiary hearings. In any proceeding under this section
relating to a child of school age, certified copies of school records relating
to attendance and academic progress of such child are admissible in evidence;</para>
<para>(f) Shall be responsible for making recommendations to the
court regarding the temporary and permanent placement of the protected juvenile
and shall submit a written report to the court at every dispositional or review
hearing, or in the alternative, the court may provide the guardian ad litem
with a checklist that shall be completed and presented to the court at every
dispositional or review hearing;</para>
<para>(g) Shall consider such other information as is warranted
by the nature and circumstances of a particular case; and</para>

the subject of a juvenile court petition.</para>

court may order the expense of such consultation, if any, to be paid by the
county in which the juvenile court action is brought or the court may, after
notice and hearing, assess the cost of such consultation, if any, in whole
or in part to the parents of the juvenile. The ability of the parents to pay
and the amount of the payment shall be determined by the court by appropriate
examination.</para>
