adjustment.</catchline><para>(1) Beginning July 1, 2000, and each
July 1 thereafter, current benefits paid to a member or beneficiary shall
be adjusted so that the purchasing power of the benefit being paid is not
less than seventy-five percent of the purchasing power of the initial benefit.
The purchasing power of the initial benefit in any year following the year
in which the initial benefit commenced shall be calculated by dividing the
United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price
Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers factor on June 30 of the
current year by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical
Workers factor on June 30 of the year in which the benefit commenced. The
result shall be multiplied by the product that results when the amount of
the initial benefit is multiplied by seventy-five percent. In any year in
which applying the adjustment provided in subsection (2) of this section results
in a benefit which would be less than seventy-five percent of the purchasing
power of the initial benefit as calculated above, the adjustment shall instead
be equal to the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage
Earners and Clerical Workers factor from the prior year to the current year.
In all other years, the adjustment provided under subsection (2) of this section
shall be provided. The adjustment pursuant to this subsection shall not cause
a current benefit to be reduced.</para>

<para>(a) Beginning July 1, 2000, and until July 1, 2001, the current
benefit of a member or the beneficiary of such a member shall be increased
annually by the lesser of (i) the percentage change in the Consumer Price
Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers factor published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the
prior year or (ii) two percent; and</para>
<para>(b) Beginning July 1, 2001, the current benefit of a member
or the beneficiary of such a member shall be increased annually by the lesser

and Clerical Workers factor published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of
the United States Department of Labor for the prior year or (ii) two and one-half
percent.</para>
<para>(3) The state shall contribute to the Nebraska Retirement
Fund for Judges an annual level dollar payment certified by the board. For
the 1996-97 fiscal year through the 2012-13 fiscal year, the annual
level dollar payment certified by the board shall equal 1.04778 percent of
six million eight hundred ninety-five thousand dollars.</para>
<para>(4) The board shall adjust the annual benefit adjustment
provided in this section so that the total amount of all cost-of-living adjustments
provided to the eligible retiree at the time of the annual benefit adjustment
does not exceed the percentage change in the National Consumer Price Index
for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers factor published by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics for the period between June 30 of the prior year to June
30 of the present year. If the consumer price index used in this section is
discontinued or replaced, a substitute index published by the United States
Department of Labor shall be selected by the board which shall be a reasonable
representative measurement of the cost of living for retired employees.</para>
