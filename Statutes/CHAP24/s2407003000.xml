misdemeanor or infraction, and city or village ordinance violation filed in

No judges retirement fee shall be charged for filing a report pursuant to

or county court, such fees shall be paid and information submitted to the
director in charge of the judges retirement system on forms prescribed by
the board by the clerk within ten days after the close of each calendar quarter.
The board may charge a late administrative processing fee not to exceed twenty-five
dollars if the information is not timely received or the money is delinquent.
In addition, the board may charge a late fee of thirty-eight thousandths of
one percent of the amount required to be submitted pursuant to this section
for each day such amount has not been received. Such director shall promptly
thereafter remit the same to the State Treasurer for credit to the fund. No
Nebraska Retirement Fund for Judges fee which is uncollectible for any reason

<para>(4) All expenditures from the fund shall be authorized by

<para>(5) The fund shall consist of the total fund as of December

court fees as provided in subsection (3) of this section, and any required
contributions of the state.</para>
<para>(6) Not later than January 1 of each year, the State Treasurer
shall transfer to the fund the amount certified by the board as being necessary
to pay the cost of any benefits accrued during the fiscal year ending the
previous June 30 in excess of member contributions for that fiscal year and
court fees as provided in subsection (3) of this section and fees pursuant
to sections 25-2804, 33-103, 33-103.01, 33-106, 33-106.02, 33-123, 33-125,
33-126.02, 33-126.03, and 33-126.06 and directed to be remitted to the fund,
if any, for that fiscal year plus any required contributions of the state
as provided in subsection (9) of this section.</para>
<para>(7) Benefits under the retirement system to members or to
their beneficiaries shall be paid from the fund.</para>
<para>(8) Any member who is making contributions to the fund on
December 25, 1969, may, on or before June 30, 1970, elect to become a future
member by delivering written notice of such election to the board.</para>
<para>(9) Not later than January 1 of each year, the State Treasurer
shall transfer to the fund an amount, determined on the basis of an actuarial
valuation as of the previous June 30 and certified by the board, to fully
fund the unfunded accrued liabilities of the retirement system as of June
30, 1988, by level payments up to January 1, 2000. Such valuation shall be
on the basis of actuarial assumptions recommended by the actuary, approved
by the board, and kept on file with the board. For the fiscal year beginning
July 1, 2013, and each fiscal year
thereafter, the actuary for the board shall perform an actuarial valuation
of the system using the entry age actuarial cost method. Under this method,
the actuarially required funding rate is equal to the normal cost rate, plus
the contribution rate necessary to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued
liability on a level percentage of salary basis.
The normal cost under this method shall be determined for each individual
member on a level percentage of salary basis. The normal cost amount is then
summed for all members. Beginning July 1, 2006, any existing
unfunded liabilities shall be reinitialized and amortized over a thirty-year
period, and during each subsequent actuarial valuation, changes in the funded
actuarial accrued liability due to changes in benefits, actuarial assumptions,
the asset valuation method, or actuarial gains or losses shall be measured
and amortized over a thirty-year period beginning on the valuation date of
such change. If the unfunded actuarial accrued liability under the entry age
actuarial cost method is zero or less than zero on an actuarial valuation
date, then all prior unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities shall be considered
fully funded and the unfunded actuarial accrued liability shall be reinitialized
and amortized over a thirty-year period as of the actuarial valuation date.
If the actuarially required contribution rate exceeds the rate of all contributions
required pursuant to the Judges Retirement Act, there shall be a supplemental
appropriation sufficient to pay for the differences between the actuarially
required contribution rate and the rate of all contributions required pursuant
to the Judges Retirement Act.</para>
<para>(10) The state or county shall pick up the member contributions
required by this section for all compensation paid on or after January 1,
1985, and the contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h)(2) of the Internal
Revenue Code in determining federal tax treatment under the code
and shall not be included as gross income of the member until
such time as they are distributed or made available. The contributions, although designated as member contributions,
shall be paid by the state or county in lieu of member contributions. The
state or county shall pay these member contributions from the same source
of funds which is used in paying earnings to the member. The state or county
shall pick up these contributions by a compensation deduction through a reduction
in the compensation of the member. Member contributions picked up shall be
treated for all purposes of the Judges Retirement Act in the same manner and
to the extent as member contributions made prior to the date picked up.</para>
