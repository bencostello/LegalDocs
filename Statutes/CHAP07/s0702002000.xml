A need exists for public legal service entities to hire competent attorneys. The public is better served by competent and qualified attorneys working in the area of public legal service. Programs providing educational loan forgiveness will encourage law students and other attorneys to seek employment in the area of public legal service and will enable public legal service entities to attract and retain qualified attorneys.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2008, LB1014, &#167;  20.</para></source>  </law></legaldoc>
