<para>(1)(a) The Nebraska Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act
shall provide coverage for the policies and contracts specified in subsection
(2) of this section:</para>
<para>(i) To persons who, regardless of where they reside, except for nonresident
certificate holders under group policies or contracts, are the beneficiaries,
assignees, or payees of the persons covered under subdivision (1)(a)(ii) of
this section; and</para>
<para>(ii) To persons who are owners of or certificate holders under the policies
or contracts, other than structured settlement annuities, and in each case
who:</para>
<para>(A) Are residents; or</para>
<para>(B) Are not residents and all of the following conditions apply:</para>
<para>(I) The insurer that issued the policies or contracts is domiciled in
this state;</para>
<para>(II) The states in which the persons reside have associations similar
to the association created by the act; and</para>
<para>(III) The persons are not eligible for coverage by an association in
any other state due to the fact that the insurer was not licensed in the state
at the time specified in the state's guaranty association law.</para>
<para>(b) For structured settlement annuities specified in subsection (2)
of this section, subdivisions (1)(a)(i) and (ii) of this section do not apply.
The act shall, except as provided in subdivisions (1)(c) and (d) of this section,
provide coverage to a person who is a payee under a structured settlement
annuity, or beneficiary of a payee if the payee is deceased, if the payee:</para>
<para>(i) Is a resident, regardless of where the contract owner resides; or</para>
<para>(ii) Is not a resident, but only under the following conditions:</para>
<para>(A)(I) The contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is a
resident; or</para>
<para>(II) The contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is not
a resident, but the insurer that issued the structured settlement annuity
is domiciled in this state and the state in which the contract owner resides
has an association similar to the association created by the act; and</para>
<para>(B) The payee or beneficiary and the contract owner are not eligible
for coverage by the association of the state in which the payee or contract
owner resides.</para>
<para>(c) The act shall not provide coverage to a person who is a payee or
beneficiary of a contract owner resident of this state if the payee or beneficiary
is afforded any coverage by the association of another state.</para>
<para>(d) The act is intended to provide coverage to a person who is a resident
of this state and, in special circumstances, to a nonresident. To avoid duplicate
coverage, if a person who would otherwise receive coverage under the act is
provided coverage under the laws of any other state, the person shall not
be provided coverage under the act. In determining the application of the
provisions of this subdivision in situations in which a person could be covered
by the association of more than one state, whether as an owner, payee, beneficiary,
or assignee, the act shall be construed in conjunction with other state laws
to result in coverage by only one association.</para>
<para>(2)(a) The act shall provide coverage to the persons specified in subsection

<para>(A) Averaged over the period of four years prior to the date on which
the member insurer becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer under the act,
whichever is earlier, exceeds the rate of interest determined by subtracting
two percentage points from Moody's corporate bond yield average averaged for
that same four-year period or for such lesser period if the policy or contract
was issued less than four years before the member insurer becomes an impaired
or insolvent insurer under the act, whichever is earlier; and</para>

or insolvent insurer under the act, whichever is earlier, exceeds the rate
of interest determined by subtracting three percentage points from Moody's
corporate bond yield average as most recently available;</para>

frequently than annually, then for purposes of determining the values that
have been credited and are not subject to forfeiture under this subdivision,
