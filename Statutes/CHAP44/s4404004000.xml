all individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued in a particular calendar year on or after January 1 of the calendar year next following August 30, 1981; all annuities and pure endowments purchased in a particular calendar year on or after January 1 of the calendar year next following August 30, 1981, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts; and the net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1 of the calendar year next following August 30, 1981, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts.</para><para>The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates shall be determined as provided in this paragraph and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent: (i) For life insurance, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate shall be equal to the sum of (a) three percent; (b) the weighting factor defined in this subdivision multiplied by the difference between (1) the lesser of the reference interest rate defined in this subdivision and nine percent, and (2) three percent; and (c) one-half the weighting factor defined in this subdivision multiplied by the difference between (1) the greater of the reference interest rate defined in this subdivision and nine percent, and (2) nine percent. (ii) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates shall be equal to the sum of (a) three percent and (b) the weighting factor defined in this subdivision multiplied by the difference between (1) the reference interest rate defined in this subdivision and (2) three percent. (iii) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue-year basis, except as stated in (ii) above, the formula for life insurance in (i) above shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of ten years, and the formula for single premium immediate annuities in (ii) above shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of ten years or less. (iv) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities in (ii) above shall apply. (v) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities in (ii) above shall apply. (vi) However, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this sentence differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980 (using the reference interest rate defined for 1979) and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when section 44-407.24 becomes operative.</para><para>The weighting factors referred to in the formulas stated in this subdivision are as follows: (i) For life insurance, with a guarantee duration of ten years or less, the weighting factor is .50; with a guarantee duration of more than ten years but not more than twenty years, the weighting factor is .45; and with a guarantee duration of more than twenty years, the weighting factor is .35. For life insurance, the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values or both which are guaranteed in the original policy. (ii) The weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options is .80. (iii) The weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts, except as stated in (ii) above, are as follows, according to plan type as defined in this subdivision: (a) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue-year basis with a guarantee duration of five years or less, the weighting factor is .80 for plan type A, .60 for plan type B, and .50 for plan type C; with a guarantee duration of more than five years but not more than ten years, the weighting factor is .75 for plan type A, .60 for plan type B, and .50 for plan type C; with a guarantee duration of more than ten years but not more than twenty years, the weighting factor is .65 for plan type A, .50 for plan type B, and .45 for plan type C; and with more than twenty years guarantee duration the weighting factor is .45 for plan type A, .35 for plan type B, and .35 for plan type C. (b) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue-year basis (other than those with no cash settlement options) which do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase, the weighting factors are the factors shown in (iii)(a) above increased by .05 for all plan types. (c) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis, the weighting factors are the factors as computed in (iii)(b) above increased by .10 for plan type A, increased by .20 for plan type B, and not increased for plan type C. (d) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis which do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than twelve months beyond the valuation date, the weighting factors are the factors as computed in (iii)(c) above increased by .05 for all plan types. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of twenty years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence.</para><para>Plan types used in this subdivision are defined as follows: Under plan type A, at any time a policyholder may withdraw funds only with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, without such an adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or as an immediate life annuity, or no withdrawal may be permitted. Under plan type B, before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, a policyholder may withdraw funds only with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company or without such an adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or no withdrawal may be permitted. At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without such adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five years. Under plan type C, a policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of the interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five years either without an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.</para><para>A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue-year basis or on a change in fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue-year basis. As used in this subdivision, an issue-year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and the change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.</para><para>The reference interest rate referred to in this subdivision shall be defined as follows: (i) For all life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of the reference monthly average as defined in this subdivision. (ii) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of the reference monthly average as defined in this subdivision. (iii) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in (ii) above, with guarantee duration in excess of ten years the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the reference monthly average as defined in this subdivision. (iv) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in (ii) above, with guarantee duration of ten years or less, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the reference monthly average as defined in this subdivision. (v) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the reference monthly average as defined in this subdivision. (vi) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in (ii) above, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of the reference monthly average as defined in this subdivision.</para><para>The reference monthly average referred to in this subdivision shall mean a monthly bond yield average which is published by a national financial statistical organization, recognized by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, in current general use in the insurance industry, and designated by the Director of Insurance. In the event that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate is necessary, an alternative method, which is adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by regulation promulgated by the Department of Insurance, may be substituted.</para><para>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (e) and (h) of this section, reserves according to the Commissioners Reserve Valuation Methods, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of such future guaranteed benefits provided for by such policies, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor. The modified net premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for such benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of such benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of (i) over (ii), as follows: (i) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of such benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due; <emphasis type="italic">Provided,</emphasis> that such net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of such policy; (ii) a net one year term premium for such benefits provided for in the first policy year.</para><para>For any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1 of the fourth calendar year commencing after August 30, 1981, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the reserve according to the Commissioners Reserve Valuation Methods as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined herein as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than such excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in subdivision (h) of this section, be the greater of the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in the preceding paragraph, and the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in the preceding paragraph but with (i) the net level annual premium calculated as described in the preceding paragraph being reduced by fifteen percent of the amount of such excess first year premium, (ii) all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, (iii) the policy being assumed to mature on such date as an endowment, and (iv) the cash surrender value provided on such date being considered as an endowment benefit. In making the above comparison the mortality and interest bases stated in subdivisions (a) and (c) of this section shall be used.</para><para>Reserves according to the Commissioners Reserve Valuation Methods for (i) life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums, (ii) group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership, limited liability company, or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, (iii) disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts, and (iv) all other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of this subdivision, except that any extra premiums charged because of impairments or special hazards shall be disregarded in the determination of modified net premiums.</para><para>(e) This subdivision shall apply to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership, limited liability company, or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.</para><para>Reserves according to the commissioners annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided for by such contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of such contract, that become payable prior to the end of such respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate, or rates, specified in such contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations shall be the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of such contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.</para><para>(f) In no event shall a company's aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in subdivisions (d), (e), (h), and (i) of this section and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for such policies.</para><para>(g) Reserves for all policies and contracts issued prior to August 30, 1981, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all such policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately prior to such date.</para><para>Reserves for any category of policies, contracts, or benefits as established by the Department of Insurance, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for such category than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be higher than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided for therein.</para><para>(h) If in any contract year the gross premium charged by any life insurance company on any policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for such policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for such policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for such policy or contract, but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this subdivision are those standards stated in subdivisions (a) and (c) of this section.</para><para>For any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1 of the fourth calendar year commencing after August 30, 1981, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the foregoing provisions of this subdivision shall be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for such policy were the method described in subdivision (d) of this section, ignoring the second paragraph of subdivision (d) of this section. The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with subdivision (d) of this section, including the second paragraph of that subdivision, and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this subdivision.</para><para>(i) In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance or annuity which is of such a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in subdivisions (d), (e), and (h) of this section, the reserves which are held under any such plan must (i) be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan, and (ii) be computed by a method which is consistent with the principles of this section as determined by regulations promulgated by the Department of Insurance.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1913, c. 154, &#167; 94, p. 437; </para><para>R.S.1913, &#167; 3231; </para><para>Laws 1919, c. 190, tit.
