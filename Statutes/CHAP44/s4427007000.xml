The election shall be effected by a notice to the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator and to the affected reinsurers. If the association makes an election, subdivisions (13)(a)(i) through (iv) of this section apply to the agreements selected by the association:</para><para>(i) The association shall be responsible for all unpaid premiums due under the agreements for periods both before and after the coverage date and shall be responsible for the performance of all other obligations to be performed after the coverage date in each case that relates to contracts covered, either in whole or in part, by the association. The association may charge contracts covered in part by the association, through reasonable allocation methods, the costs for reinsurance in excess of the obligations of the association;</para><para>(ii) The association shall be entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the agreements with respect to losses or events that occur in periods after the coverage date and that relate to contracts covered by the association, in whole or in part, except that on receiving such amounts, the association shall pay to the beneficiary under the policy or contract on account of which the amounts were paid a portion of the amount equal to the excess of: (A) The amount received by the association, over (B) the benefits paid by the association on account of the policy or contract less the retention of the impaired or insolvent member insurer applicable to the loss or event;</para><para>(iii) Within thirty days after the association's election, the association and each indemnity reinsurer shall calculate the net balance due to or from the association under each reinsurance agreement as of the date of the association's election, giving full credit to all items paid by either the member insurer, or its receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator, or the indemnity reinsurer during the period between the coverage date and the date of the association's election. The association or indemnity reinsurer shall pay the net balance due the other within five days after the completion of such calculation. If the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator has received any amounts due the association pursuant to subdivision (13)(a)(ii) of this section, the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator shall, as promptly as practicable, pay such amounts to the association; and</para><para>(iv) If the association, within sixty days after the election, pays the premiums due for periods both before and after the coverage date that relate to contracts covered by the association in whole or in part, the reinsurer shall not be entitled to terminate the reinsurance agreements to the extent that the agreements relate to contracts covered by the association either wholly or partially and may not set off any unpaid premium due for periods prior to the coverage date against amounts due the association;</para><para>(b) If the association transfers its obligations to another insurer and if the association and the other insurer agree, such insurer shall succeed to the rights and obligations of the association under subdivision (13)(a) of this section effective as of the date agreed upon by the association and such insurer and regardless of whether the association has made the election referred to in subdivision (13)(a) of this section except that:</para><para>(i) The indemnity reinsurance agreements shall automatically terminate for new reinsurance unless the indemnity reinsurer and the other insurer agree to the contrary;</para><para>(ii) The obligations described in the exception set forth in subdivision (13)(a)(ii) of this section shall not apply on and after the date the indemnity reinsurance agreement is transferred to the third party insurer; and</para><para>(iii) Subdivision (13)(b) of this section shall not apply if the association has previously stated in writing that it will not exercise the election referred to in subdivision (13)(a) of this section;</para><para>(c) The provisions of subdivision (13) of this section shall supersede the provisions of any law of this state or of any affected reinsurance agreement that provides for or requires any payment of reinsurance proceeds on account of losses or events that occur in periods after the coverage date to the receiver, liquidator, or rehabilitator of the insolvent member insurer. The receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator shall remain entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance agreement with respect to losses or events that occur in periods prior to the coverage date, subject to applicable setoff provisions; and</para><para>(d) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in subdivision (13) of this section, nothing in such subdivision shall alter or modify the terms and conditions of the indemnity reinsurance agreements of the insolvent member insurer. Nothing in the subdivision shall abrogate or limit any rights of any reinsurer to claim that it is entitled to rescind a reinsurance agreement. Nothing in such subdivision shall give a policyowner or beneficiary an independent cause of action against an indemnity reinsurer that is not otherwise set forth in the indemnity reinsurance agreement;</para><para>(14) The board of directors of the association shall have discretion and may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the association is to provide the benefits of the act in an economical and efficient manner;</para><para>(15) If the association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits of the act to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association's obligations under the act, such person shall not be entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement; and</para><para>(16) Venue in an action against the association arising under the act shall be in the district court of Lancaster County. The association shall not be required to give an appeal bond in an appeal that relates to a cause of action arising under the act.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1975, LB 217, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 1986, LB 593, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 2001, LB 360, &#167; 16; </para><para>Laws 2003, LB 216, &#167; 11. </para></source><annotation><para>This section does not encompass the liability of an insolvent insurer arising under law rather than under the provisions of the policy such insurer issued.
