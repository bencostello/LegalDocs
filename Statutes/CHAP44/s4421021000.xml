The Insurance Holding Company System Act applies equally, regardless of whether the would-be acquiring party is a Nebraska resident, and as such does not resemble the principal objects of dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny, which are statutes that discriminate against interstate commerce. The Insurance Holding Company System Act poses no threat of inconsistent regulations, because it regulates only the internal affairs of insurers registered in this state and thus survives scrutiny under the Commerce Clause.
