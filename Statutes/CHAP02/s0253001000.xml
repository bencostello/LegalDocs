Such measures may potentially include the establishment of systems of trading in credits for adoption of practices, technologies, or other measures which decrease net emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.</para><para>Improved agricultural production methods, soil conservation practices, and other methods of stewardship of soil resources have great potential to increase carbon sequestration on agricultural lands and help offset carbon dioxide emissions from other sectors of the economy. It is in the interest of agricultural producers and the public in general that the Director of Natural Resources document and quantify carbon sequestration and greenhouse emissions reductions associated with agricultural practices, management systems, and land uses occurring on cropland and rangeland in Nebraska. It is the intent of the Legislature that efforts to quantify and verify carbon sequestration on agricultural land will enhance the ability of the state's agricultural landowners to participate in any system of carbon or greenhouse emissions marketing or trading.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2000, LB 957, &#167; 1.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
