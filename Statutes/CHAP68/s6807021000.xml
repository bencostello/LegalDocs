pregnant United States citizen and Nebraska resident with an income at or
below one hundred eighty-five percent of the federal poverty level who is
subject to a child support enforcement sanction may ask for her case to be
reviewed by the chief executive officer of the Department of Health and Human
Services to obtain prenatal services from state-only funds. If the chief executive
officer, upon review of the circumstances of the case, determines, in his
or her discretion, that circumstances relating to domestic violence warrant
an exception to the existing rules and regulations governing medicaid coverage
and sanctions, he or she may authorize prenatal services to be paid from state
general funds. Prenatal services provided under this section shall not include
abortion counseling, referral for abortion, or funding for abortion.</para>
