The Legislature further recognizes that arresting the continued deterioration of buildings, limiting the effects of inflation on the costs of such deferred maintenance, repair, renovation, and facility replacement construction, and bringing such buildings into compliance with current health and safety requirements at the earliest possible time is necessary for protecting such investment in the buildings of the State of Nebraska. In order to accomplish these goals, it is necessary, desirable, and advisable that the Legislature provide for the receipt of funds for such purposes as soon as practicable with the repayment of such funds to be made over a period of years. The Legislature recognizes the commitment of (a) the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska to provide matching funds on a one-to-one basis up to five million five hundred thousand dollars per year for a total of up to fifty-five million dollars and (b) the Board of Trustees of the Nebraska State Colleges to provide matching funds on a one-to-one basis up to four hundred thousand dollars per year for a total of four million dollars.</para><para>(2) Sections 85-412 to 85-418 do not modify, reduce, or eliminate any provision of subsection (10) of section 85-1414 requiring the approval of the Coordinating Commission for Postsecondary Education for any deferred maintenance, repair, renovation, or facility replacement construction project authorized by sections 85-414 and 85-417 and undertaken by the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska or the Board of Trustees of the Nebraska State Colleges.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1998, LB 1100, &#167; 1. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
