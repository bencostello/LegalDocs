state are directly related to educational levels and skills of the citizens
of the state and that a vital and valid public purpose is served by the creation
and implementation of programs which encourage and make possible the attainment
of higher education by the greatest number of citizens of the state. The state
has limited resources to provide additional programs for higher education
funding and the continued operation and maintenance of the state's public
institutions of higher education, and the general welfare of the citizens
of the state will be enhanced by establishing a program which allows parents
and others interested in the higher education of our youth to invest money
in a public trust for future application to the payment of higher education
costs. The creation of the means of encouragement for persons to invest in
such a program represents the carrying out of a vital and valid public purpose.
In order to make available to parents and others interested in the higher
education of our youth an opportunity to fund future higher education needs,
it is necessary that a public trust be established in which money may be invested
for future educational use.</para>
