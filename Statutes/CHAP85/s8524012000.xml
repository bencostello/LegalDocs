operate, including any further information submitted by the applicant as required
by the commission and any investigation of the applicant as the commission
may deem necessary or appropriate, the commission shall grant or deny the
application for initial authorization to operate. A grant of an initial authorization
to operate may be on such terms and conditions as the commission may specify.
Such authorization shall be for a five-year period unless the commission determines
that a shorter period of time is appropriate based on the standards established
pursuant to section 85-2406.</para>

and any investigation of the applicant as the commission may deem necessary
or appropriate, the commission shall grant or deny the application for renewal
of an authorization to operate. Renewal of an authorization to operate may
be on such terms and conditions as the commission may specify. Such authorization
shall be for a five-year period unless the commission determines that a shorter
renewal period is appropriate based on the standards established pursuant
to section 85-2406. If the applicant has, for at least twenty academic years
under the same ownership, continuously offered one or more four-year undergraduate
programs with a physical presence in Nebraska in compliance with state and
federal law, the commission shall grant authorization to operate on a continuing

appropriate based on the standards established pursuant to section 85-2406.</para>
<para>(3) Except
as otherwise provided in this section, modifications, as defined by the commission
in rules and regulations, to an existing authorization to operate, but not
to an authorization to operate on a continuing basis, shall require an application
to the commission. After review of the application, including any further
information submitted by the applicant as required by the commission and any
investigation of the applicant as the commission may deem necessary or appropriate,
the commission shall grant or deny the application. Approval of the application
may be on such terms and conditions as the commission may specify. Such authorization
shall replace the existing authorization to operate and shall be for a five-year
period unless the commission determines that a shorter period of time is appropriate
based on the standards established pursuant to section 85-2406.</para>
<para>(4) If an
application for an initial authorization to operate or a modification to an
existing authorization to operate includes a request to establish a new campus
in this state, as defined by the commission in rules and regulations, the
commission shall hold a public hearing. The hearing shall be scheduled following
a completed review of the application for authorization to operate or the
modification of an authorization to operate, including any further information
submitted by the applicant as required by the commission and any investigation
of the applicant as the commission may deem necessary or appropriate, and
shall be conducted according to the Administrative Procedure Act. After the
public hearing, the commission shall grant or deny the application. A grant
of authorization to operate or the modification of an authorization to operate
may be on such terms and conditions as the commission may specify. Such authorization
or modification shall be for a five-year period unless the commission determines
that a shorter period of time is appropriate based on the standards established
pursuant to section 85-2406.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2011, LB637, &#167; 12.</para></source><crossreference><para><emphasis>Administrative Procedure Act,</emphasis> see section 84-920.</para></crossreference>  </law>
