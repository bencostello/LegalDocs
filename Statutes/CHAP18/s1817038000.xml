motor vehicle for which it is issued, is not to be altered or reproduced,
and is to be used only when a handicapped or disabled person or a temporarily
handicapped or disabled person will enter or exit the motor vehicle while
it is parked in a designated parking space or access aisle. The application
form shall provide space for the applicant to sign a statement that he or
she is aware of his or her rights, duties, and responsibilities with regard
to the use and possession of a permit and the penalties provided by law for
handicapped parking infractions. The application form shall also indicate
