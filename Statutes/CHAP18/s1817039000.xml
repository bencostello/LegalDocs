The permit to be issued pursuant to section 18-1738 or 18-1738.01 shall be
constructed of a durable plastic designed to resist normal wear or fading
for the term of the permit's issuance and printed so as to minimize the possibility
of alteration following issuance. The permit shall be of a design, size, configuration,
color, and construction and contain such information as specified in the rules
and regulations adopted and promulgated by the United States Department of
Transportation in the Uniform System for Parking for Persons with Disabilities,
23 C.F.R. part 1235, as such regulations existed on January 1, 2010.</para>
<para>(2) In addition to the requirements of subsection (1) of this section,
the permit shall show the expiration date and such identifying information
with regard to the handicapped or disabled person or temporarily handicapped
or disabled person to whom it is issued as is necessary to the enforcement
of sections 18-1736 to 18-1741.07 as determined by the Department of Motor
Vehicles. The expiration date information shall be distinctively color-coded
so as to identify by color the year in which the permit is due to expire.</para>
<para>(3) No permit shall be issued to any person or for any motor vehicle
if any parking permit has been issued to such person or for such motor vehicle
and such permit has been suspended pursuant to section 18-1741. At the expiration
of such suspension, a permit may be renewed in the manner provided for renewal
in sections 18-1738, 18-1738.01, and 18-1740.</para>
<para>(4) A duplicate permit may be provided without cost if the original
permit is destroyed, lost, or stolen. Such duplicate permit shall be issued
in the same manner as the original permit, except that a newly completed medical
form need not be provided if a completed medical form submitted at the time
of the most recent application for a permit or its renewal is on file with
the clerk or designated county official or the Department of Motor Vehicles.
A duplicate permit shall be valid for the remainder of the period for which
the original permit was issued.</para>
