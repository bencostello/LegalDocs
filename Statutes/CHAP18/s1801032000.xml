When any such code, or portion thereof, has been incorporated by reference into any ordinance, as provided in this section, it shall have the same force and effect as though it had been spread at large in such ordinance without further or additional posting or publication thereof. Not less than one copy of such standard code, or portion thereof, shall be filed for use and examination by the public in the office of the clerk of such city or village prior to the adoption thereof. The adoption of any such standard code by reference shall be construed to incorporate such amendments thereto as may be made in such standard code from time to time, if the copy of such standard code so filed is at all times kept current in the office of the clerk of such city or village. If there is no ordinance adopting a plumbing code in effect in a city or village, the American National Standards Institute Uniform Plumbing Code, ANSI A40-1993, shall serve as the plumbing code for all the area within the jurisdiction of the city or village. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as creating an obligation for the city or village to inspect plumbing work done within its jurisdiction to determine compliance with the plumbing code.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1933, c. 111, &#167; 1, p. 451; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 18-1501; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 18-132; </para><para>Laws 1984, LB 748, &#167; 1; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 1304, &#167; 1. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
