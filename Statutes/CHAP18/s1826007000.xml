Any such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The money so pledged and thereafter received by the municipality or deposited into its respective account shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the municipality, irrespective of whether the parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1989, LB 683, &#167; 8; </para><para>Laws 2000, LB 968, &#167; 10. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
