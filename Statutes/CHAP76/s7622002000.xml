finds that as a result of the enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as the act existed on January 1, 2010,
Nebraska's laws providing for regulation of real property appraisers require
restructuring in order to comply with Title XI of the act. Compliance with
the act is necessary to ensure an adequate number of appraisers in Nebraska
to conduct appraisals of real estate involved in federally related transactions
as defined in the act.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1990, LB 1153, &#167; 2; </para><para>Laws 1991, LB 203, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 1994, LB 1107, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 2006, LB 778, &#167; 14; </para><para>Laws 2010, LB931, &#167; 1.</para></source>  </law>
