<para>The Legislature finds that as a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, as the act existed on January 1, 2012, and the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as the act existed
on January 1, 2012, Nebraska's laws providing
for regulation of real property appraisers require restructuring in order
to comply with such acts. Compliance
with the acts is necessary to ensure
an adequate number of appraisers in Nebraska to conduct appraisals of real
estate involved in federally related transactions as defined in such acts.</para>
