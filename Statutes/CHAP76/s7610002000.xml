purpose.</catchline><para>(1) Transfers in trust of real property may be made
to secure (a) existing debts or obligations created simultaneously with the
execution of the trust deed, (b) future advances necessary to protect the
security, (c) any future advances to be made at the option of the parties,
or (d) the performance of an obligation of any other person named in the trust
deed to a beneficiary.</para>
<para>(2) Future advances necessary to protect the security shall include,
but not be limited to, advances for payment of real property taxes, special
assessments, prior liens, hazard insurance premiums, maintenance charges imposed
under a condominium declaration or other covenant, and costs of repair, maintenance,
or improvements.</para>
<para>(3)(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this subsection, all
items identified in subsection (1) of this section are equally secured by
the trust deed from the time of filing the trust deed as provided by law and
have the same priority as the trust deed over the rights of all other persons
who acquire any rights in or liens upon the trust property subsequent to the
time the trust deed was filed.</para>
<para>(b)(i) The trustor or his or her successor in title may limit the amount
of optional future advances secured by the trust deed under subdivision (1)(c) of this section by
filing a notice for record in the office of the register of deeds of each
county in which the trust property or some part thereof is situated. A copy
of such notice shall be sent by certified mail to the beneficiary at the address
of the beneficiary set forth in the trust deed. The amount of such secured
optional future advances shall be limited to not less than the amount actually
advanced at the time of receipt of such notice by the beneficiary.</para>
<para>(ii) If any optional future advance is made by the beneficiary to the
trustor or his or her successor in title after receiving written notice of
the filing for record of any trust deed, mortgage, lien, or claim against
such trust property, then the amount of such optional future advance shall
be junior to such trust deed, mortgage, lien, or claim. The notice under this
subdivision shall be sent by certified mail to the beneficiary at the address
of the beneficiary set forth in the trust deed.</para>
<para>(iii) Subdivisions (b)(i) and (ii) of this subsection shall not limit
or determine the priority of optional future advances as against construction
liens governed by section 52-139.</para>
<para>(4) The reduction to zero or elimination of the obligation evidenced
by any of the transfers in trust authorized by this section shall not invalidate
the operation of this section as to any future advances unless a notice or
release to the contrary is filed for record as provided by law. All right,
title, interest, and claim in and to the trust property acquired by the trustor
or his or her successors in interest subsequent to the execution of the trust
deed shall inure to the trustee as security for the obligation or obligations
for which the trust property is conveyed in like manner as if acquired before
execution of the trust deed.</para>
