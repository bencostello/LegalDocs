hundred dollars of taxable valuation for aid calculated for school fiscal
year 2008-09 and at least one dollar per one hundred dollars of taxable valuation

to subdivisions (2)(b) and (2)(c) of section 77-3442. The averaging adjustment
for aid calculated for school fiscal year 2008-09 shall equal seventy-five
