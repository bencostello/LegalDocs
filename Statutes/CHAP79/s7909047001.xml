adjustment.</catchline><para>(1) Beginning July 1, 2000, and each
July 1 thereafter, current benefits paid to a member or beneficiary shall
be adjusted so that the purchasing power of the benefit being paid is not
less than seventy-five percent of the purchasing power of the initial benefit.
The purchasing power of the initial benefit in any year following the year
in which the initial benefit commenced shall be calculated by dividing the
United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price
Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers factor on June 30 of the
current year by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical
Workers factor on June 30 of the year in which the benefit commenced. The
result shall be multiplied by the product that results when the amount of
the initial benefit is multiplied by seventy-five percent. In any year in
which applying the adjustment provided in subsection (2) of this section results
in a benefit which would be less than seventy-five percent of the purchasing
power of the initial benefit as calculated above, the adjustment shall instead
be equal to the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage
Earners and Clerical Workers factor from the prior year to the current year.
In all other years, the adjustment provided under subsection (2) of this section
shall be provided. The adjustment pursuant to this subsection shall not cause
a current benefit to be reduced.</para>
<para>(2) Except as provided in subsection (1) of this section:</para>
<para>(a) Beginning July 1, 2000, and until July 1, 2001, the current
benefit of a member or the beneficiary of such a member shall be increased
annually by the lesser of (i) the percentage change in the Consumer Price
Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers factor published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the
prior year or (ii) two percent; and</para>
<para>(b) Beginning July 1, 2001, the current benefit to a member
or the beneficiary of such a member shall be increased annually by the lesser
of (i) the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners
and Clerical Workers factor published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of
the United States Department of Labor for the prior year or (ii) two and one-half
percent.</para>
<para>(3) The state shall contribute to the Annuity Reserve Fund
an annual level dollar payment certified by the board. For the 1996-97 fiscal
year through the 2012-13 fiscal year, the annual
level dollar payment certified by the board shall equal 81.7873 percent of
six million eight hundred ninety-five thousand dollars.</para>
<para>(4) The retirement board shall adjust the annual benefit
adjustment provided in this section so that the total amount of all cost-of-living
adjustments provided to the eligible retiree at the time of the annual benefit
adjustment does not exceed the percentage change in the National Consumer
Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers factor published by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the period between June 30 of the prior
year to June 30 of the present year. If the consumer price index used in this
section is discontinued or replaced, a substitute index published by the United
States Department of Labor shall be selected by the board which shall be a
reasonable representative measurement of the cost of living for retired employees.</para>
<para>(5) In addition to the adjustments provided in subsections
(1), (2), and (4) of this section, the current benefit to a member or beneficiary
of such member, and for which the first payment was dated on or before June
30, 2007, shall be subject to adjustment of the greater of (a) the annuity
payable to the member or beneficiary as adjusted, if applicable, under the
provisions of subsection (1), (2), or (4) of this section or (b) eighty-five
percent of the annuity which results when the original annuity that was paid
to the member or beneficiary, before any cost-of-living adjustments under
this section, is adjusted by the increase in the Consumer Price Index for
Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers for the period between the commencement
date of the annuity and June 30, 2007.</para>
