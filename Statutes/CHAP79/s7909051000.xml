disability; conditions; application.</catchline><para>(1) A member
shall be retired on account of disability, either upon his or her own application
or the application of his or her employer or a person acting in his or her
behalf, if a medical examination, made at the expense of the retirement system
and conducted by a competent disinterested physician legally authorized to
practice medicine under the laws of the state in which he or she practices,
selected by the retirement board, shows and the physician certifies to the
retirement board that the member is unable to engage in a substantially gainful
activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which began while the member was a participant
in the plan and which can be expected to result in death or be
of a long and indefinite duration. The medical examination may be waived if,
in the judgment of the retirement board, extraordinary circumstances exist
which preclude substantial gainful activity by the member. Such circumstances
shall include hospice placement or similar confinement for a terminal illness
or injury.</para>
<para>(2) The member shall have five years from the date he or
she terminates employment in a public school located in Nebraska in which
to make application for disability retirement benefits if the disability is
related to employment in a public school located in Nebraska. If the disability
is not related to a public school located in Nebraska, the member shall have
one year from the date he or she terminates employment in which to make application
for disability retirement benefits. Any application for retirement on account
of disability shall be made on a retirement application provided by the retirement
system. Upon approval by the board, benefits shall begin on the disability
retirement date.</para>
