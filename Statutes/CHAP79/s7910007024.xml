<para>(1) For school fiscal year 2008-09, aid stabilization shall be calculated
for each local system and disbursed in an amount equal to the difference of
the state aid paid to such local system for school fiscal year 2007-08 pursuant
to section 79-1022 minus two and one-half percent of the need calculated for
the school fiscal year for which aid is being calculated and minus the sum
of the calculated equalization aid, allocated income tax funds, and net option
funding for such school fiscal year, except that aid stabilization shall not
be less than zero.</para>
<para>(2) For school fiscal year 2009-10, aid stabilization shall be calculated
for each local system and disbursed in an amount equal to the difference of
the state aid paid to such local system for school fiscal year 2007-08 pursuant
to section 79-1022 minus five percent of the need calculated for the school
fiscal year for which aid is being calculated and minus the sum of the calculated
equalization aid, allocated income tax funds, and net option funding for such

the amount that was actually paid to such local system during such school
fiscal year shall be deemed the amount paid pursuant to section 79-1022.</para>
