provide for open enrollment in all school buildings in the learning community,
subject to specific limitations necessary to bring about diverse enrollments
in each school building in the learning community. Such limitations, for school
buildings other than focus schools and programs other than focus programs,
shall include giving preference at each school building first to siblings
of students who will be enrolled as continuing students in such school building
or program for the first school year for which enrollment is sought in such
school building and then to students that contribute to the socioeconomic
diversity of enrollment at each building and may include establishing zone
limitations in which students may access several schools other than their
home attendance area school. Notwithstanding the limitations necessary to
bring about diversity, open enrollment shall include providing access to students
who do not contribute to the socioeconomic diversity of a school building,
if, subsequent to the open enrollment selection process that is subject to
limitations necessary to bring about diverse enrollments, capacity remains
in a school building. In such a case, students who have applied to attend
such school building shall be selected to attend such school building on a
random basis up to the remaining capacity of such building. A student who
has otherwise been disqualified from the school building pursuant to the school
district's code of conduct or related school discipline rules shall not be
eligible for open enrollment pursuant to this section. Any student who attended
a particular school building in the prior school year and who is seeking education
in the grades offered in such school building shall be allowed to continue
attending such school building as a continuing student.</para>
<para>(b) To facilitate the open enrollment provisions of this
subsection, each school year each member school district in a learning community
shall establish a maximum capacity for each school building under such district's
control pursuant to procedures and criteria established by the learning community
coordinating council. Each member school district shall also establish attendance
areas for each school building under the district's control, except that the
school board shall not establish attendance areas for focus schools or focus
programs. The attendance areas shall be established such that all of the territory
of the school district is within an attendance area for each grade. Students
residing in a school district shall be allowed to attend a school building
in such school district.</para>
<para>(c) For purposes of this section and sections 79-238 and
79-611, student who contributes to the socioeconomic diversity of enrollment
means (i) a student who does not qualify for free or reduced-price lunches
when, based upon the certification pursuant to section 79-2120, the school
building the student will attend has more students qualifying for free or
reduced-price lunches than the average percentage of such students in all
school buildings in the learning community or (ii) a student who qualifies
for free or reduced-price lunches when, based upon the certification pursuant
to section 79-2120, the school building the student will attend has fewer
students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunches than the average percentage
of such students in all school buildings in the learning community.</para>
<para>(2)(a) On or before March 15 of each year beginning with
the year immediately following the year in which the initial coordinating
council for the learning community takes office, a parent or guardian of a
student residing in a member school district in a learning community may submit
an application to any school district in the learning community on behalf
of a student who is applying to attend a school building for the following
school year that is not in an attendance area where the applicant resides
or a focus school, focus program, or magnet school as such terms are defined
in section 79-769. On or before April 1 of each year beginning with the year
immediately following the year in which the initial coordinating council for
the learning community takes office, the school district shall accept or reject
such applications based on the capacity of the school building, the eligibility
of the applicant for the school building or program, the number of such applicants
that will be accepted for a given school building, and whether or not the
applicant contributes to the socioeconomic diversity of the school or program
to which he or she has applied and for which he or she is eligible. The school
district shall notify such parent or guardian in writing of the acceptance
or rejection.</para>
<para>(b) A parent or guardian may provide information on the application
regarding the applicant's potential qualification for free or reduced-price
lunches. Any such information provided shall be subject to verification and
shall only be used for the purposes of this section. Nothing in this section
requires a parent or guardian to provide such information. Determinations
about an applicant's qualification for free or reduced-price lunches for purposes
of this section shall be based on any verified information provided on the
application. If no such information is provided the student shall be presumed
not to qualify for free or reduced-price lunches for the purposes of this
section.</para>
<para>(c)  A student may not apply to attend a school building
in the learning community for any grades that are offered by another school
building for which the student had previously applied and been accepted pursuant
to this section, absent a hardship exception as established by the individual
school district. On or before September 1 of each year beginning with the
year immediately following the year in which the initial coordinating council
for the learning community takes office, each school district shall provide
to the learning community coordinating council a complete and accurate report
of all applications received, including the number of students who applied
at each grade level at each building, the number of students accepted at each
grade level at each building, the number of such students that contributed
to the socioeconomic diversity that applied and were accepted, the number
of applicants denied and the rationales for denial, and other such information
as requested by the learning community coordinating council.</para>
<para>(3) Each diversity plan may also include establishment of
one or more focus schools or focus programs and the involvement of every member
school district in one or more pathways across member school districts. Enrollment
in each focus school or focus program shall be designed to reflect the socioeconomic
diversity of the learning community as a whole. School district selection
of students for focus schools or focus programs shall be on a random basis
from two pools of applicants, those who qualify for free and reduced-price
lunches and those who do not qualify for free and reduced-price lunches. The
percentage of students selected for focus schools from the pool of applicants
who qualify for free and reduced-price lunches shall be as nearly equal as
possible to the percentage of the student body of the learning community who
qualify for free and reduced-price lunches. The percentage of students selected
for focus schools from the pool of applicants who do not qualify for free
and reduced-price lunches shall be as nearly equal as possible to the percentage
of the student body of the learning community who do not qualify for free
and reduced-price lunches. If more capacity exists in a focus school or program
than the number of applicants for such focus school or program that contribute
to the socioeconomic diversity of the focus school or program, the school
district shall randomly select applicants up to the number of applicants that
will be accepted for such building. A student who will complete the grades
offered at a focus program, focus school, or magnet school that is part of
a pathway shall be allowed to attend the focus program, focus school, or magnet
school offering the next grade level as part of the pathway as a continuing
student. A student who completes the grades offered at a focus program, focus
school, or magnet school shall be allowed to attend a school offering the next grade level in
the school district responsible for the focus
program, focus school, or magnet school as a continuing student. A student
who attended a program or school in the school year immediately preceding
the first school year for which the program or school will operate as a focus
program or focus school approved by the learning community and meeting the
requirements of section 79-769 and who has not completed the grades offered
at the focus program or focus school shall be a continuing student in the
program or school.</para>
<para>(4) On or before February 15 of each year beginning with
the year immediately following the year in which the initial coordinating
council for the learning community takes office, a parent or guardian of a
student who is currently attending a school building or program, except a
magnet school, focus school, or focus program, outside of the attendance area
where the student resides and who will complete the grades offered at such
school building prior to the following school year shall provide notice, on
a form provided by the school district, to the school board of the school
district containing such school building if such student will attend another
school building within such district as a continuing student and which school
building such student would prefer to attend. On or before March 1, such school
board shall provide a notice to such parent or guardian stating which school
building or buildings the student shall be allowed to attend in such school
district as a continuing student for the following school year. If the student
resides within the school district, the notice shall include the school building
offering the grade the student will be entering for the following school year
in the attendance area where the student resides. This subsection shall not
apply to focus schools or programs.</para>
<para>(5) A parent or guardian of a student who moves to a new
residence in the learning community after April 1 may apply directly to a
school board within the learning community within ninety days after moving
for the student to attend a school building outside of the attendance area
where the student resides. Such school board shall accept or reject such application
within fifteen days after receiving the application, based on the number of
applications and qualifications pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this
section for all other students.</para>
<para>(6) A parent or guardian of a student who wishes to change
school buildings for emergency or hardship reasons may apply directly to a
school board within the learning community at any time for the student to
attend a school building outside of the attendance area where the student
resides. Such application shall state the emergency or hardship and shall
be kept confidential by the school board. Such school board shall accept or
reject such application within fifteen days after receiving the application.
Applications shall only be accepted if an emergency or hardship was presented
which justifies an exemption from the procedures in subsection (4) of this
section based on the judgment of such school board, and such acceptance shall
not exceed the number of applications that will be accepted for the school
year pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this section for such building.</para>
