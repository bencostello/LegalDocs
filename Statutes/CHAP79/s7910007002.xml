or</para><para>(iv)(A) Less than two formula students per square mile in the local system and (B) the local system includes an area equal to ninety-five percent or more of the square miles in the largest county in which a high school attendance center is located in the local system; and</para><para>(c) The standard cost grouping will consist of local systems that do not qualify for the very sparse or the sparse cost groupings.</para><para>For purposes of subdivision (1) of this section, if a local system did not operate and offer instruction in grades nine through twelve within the boundaries of the local system during the school fiscal year immediately preceding the school fiscal year in which aid is to be paid, the local system shall not be considered to have a high school attendance center;</para><para>(2)(a) The department shall calculate the average formula cost per student in each cost grouping by dividing the total estimated general fund operating expenditures for the cost grouping by the difference between the total adjusted formula students for all local systems in the cost grouping minus (i) the adjusted formula students attributed to early childhood education programs approved by the department pursuant to section 79-1103 for the first two school fiscal years for which students attributed to early childhood education programs approved by the department pursuant to section 79-1103 are being included in the calculation of state aid for the local system and (ii) for the first two school fiscal years immediately following the school fiscal year in which a district in the local system received an expansion grant pursuant to section 79-1103, the difference between the adjusted formula students attributed to early childhood education programs approved by the department pursuant to section 79-1103 for the school fiscal year immediately following the school fiscal year in which a district in the local system received an expansion grant minus the adjusted formula students attributed to early childhood education programs approved by the department pursuant to section 79-1103 for the school fiscal year in which a district in the local system received an expansion grant. The average formula cost per student in each cost grouping shall not be recalculated for the final calculation of state aid pursuant to section 79-1065. The calculation of total adjusted formula students for purposes of this subdivision shall take into account the requirements of subdivision (2) of section 79-1007.01. For school fiscal years prior to school fiscal year 2008-09, the total estimated general fund operating expenditures for the cost grouping is equal to the total adjusted general fund operating expenditures for all local systems in the cost grouping multiplied by a cost growth factor.</para><para>(b) For school fiscal years prior to school fiscal year 2008-09, the cost growth factor for each cost grouping is equal to the sum of: (i) One; plus (ii) the product of two times the ratio of the difference of (A) the formula students attributable to the cost grouping without weighting or adjustment pursuant to section 79-1007.01 minus the qualified early childhood education fall membership attributable to the cost grouping without such weighting or adjustment for state aid certified pursuant to section 79-1022 minus (B) the difference of the sum of the average daily membership plus tuitioned students attributable to the cost grouping for the most recently available complete data year minus the qualified early childhood education average daily membership attributable to the cost grouping without such weighting or adjustment for the most recently available complete data year divided by the difference of the sum of the average daily membership plus tuitioned students attributable to the cost grouping for the most recently available complete data year minus the qualified early childhood education average daily membership attributable to the cost grouping without such weighting or adjustment for the most recently available complete data year, except that the ratio shall not be less than zero; plus (iii) the basic allowable growth rate pursuant to section 79-1025 for the school fiscal year in which the aid is to be distributed; plus (iv) the basic allowable growth rate pursuant to section 79-1025 for the school fiscal year immediately preceding the school fiscal year in which the aid is to be distributed; plus (v) one-half of any additional growth rate allowed by special action of school boards for the school fiscal year in which the aid is to be distributed as determined for the school fiscal year immediately preceding the school fiscal year when aid is to be distributed; plus (vi) one-half of any additional growth rate allowed by special action of the school boards for the school fiscal year immediately preceding the school fiscal year when the aid is to be distributed;</para><para>(3) For school fiscal years 2002-03 through 2006-07, each local system's formula need shall be calculated by subtracting the temporary aid adjustment factor from the sum of the local system's transportation allowance, the local system's special receipts allowance, and the product of the local system's adjusted formula students multiplied by the average formula cost per student in the local system's cost grouping. The calculation of total adjusted formula students for purposes of this subdivision shall take into account the requirements of subdivision (2) of section 79-1007.01; and</para><para>(4) For school fiscal year 2007-08, each local system's formula need shall be calculated by subtracting the temporary aid adjustment factor from the sum of the local system's transportation allowance, special receipts allowance, and distance education and telecommunications allowance and the product of the local system's adjusted formula students multiplied by the average formula cost per student in the local system's cost grouping. The calculation of total adjusted formula students for purposes of this subdivision shall take into account the requirements of subdivision (2) of section 79-1007.01. </para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1997, LB 710, &#167; 10; </para><para>Laws 1997, LB 806, &#167; 36; </para><para>Laws 1998, LB 989, &#167; 6; </para><para>Laws 1998, Spec.
