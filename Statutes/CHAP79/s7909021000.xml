shall cease only if he or she (a) withdraws his or her accumulated contributions
under section 79-955, (b) retires on a school or formula or disability retirement
allowance, or (c) dies.</para>
<para>(2) The employer
shall notify the board of the date upon which a termination has occurred.
It is the responsibility of the employer that is involved in the termination
of employment to notify the board of such change in employment and provide
the board with such information as the board deems necessary.</para>
<para>(3) The retirement board shall
reinstate to membership, with the same status as when such membership ceased,
a school employee who has withdrawn his or her accumulated contributions under
the following conditions:</para>
<para>(a) If he or she again becomes an employee and if such employee
chooses within three years after rejoining the system to repay, within five
years after the date on which he or she rejoins the retirement system or prior
to termination of employment, whichever is first, to the retirement board
part or all of the amount he or she has withdrawn plus interest which would
have accrued on that amount under the retirement system; or</para>
<para>(b) If, more than three years after again becoming an employee
and rejoining the system but prior to termination of employment, he or she
chooses to repay part or all of the amount he or she has withdrawn, plus an
amount equal to the actuarial assumed rate of return for the period repaid.
Payment must be completed within five years after electing to repay or prior
to termination, whichever is earlier.</para>
<para>(4) Prior creditable service
shall be restored in proportion to the amounts repaid. A member's prior creditable
service shall be fully restored only if the member has repaid all accumulated
withdrawals in accordance with either subdivision (3)(a) or (3)(b) of this section, as applicable.
Repayment may be made through direct payment, installment payments, or an
irrevocable payroll deduction authorization. If the school employee chooses
not to repay such withdrawals with interest, the school employee shall enter
the system as a new member with no prior rights.</para>
