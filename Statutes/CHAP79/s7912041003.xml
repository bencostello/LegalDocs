through (6) of this section.</para>
<para>(2)(a) The distance education and telecommunications allowance
for each educational service unit shall equal eighty-five percent of the difference
of the costs for telecommunications services, for access to data transmission
networks that transmit data to and from the educational service unit, and
for the transmission of data on such networks paid by the educational service
unit as reported on the annual financial report for the most recently available
complete data year minus the receipts from the federal Universal Service Fund
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 254, as such section existed on January 1, 2007, for

service unit shall equal one percent of the funds appropriated for distribution
pursuant to this section for each office of the educational service unit,
except the educational service unit headquarters, up to the maximum number
of satellite offices. The maximum number of satellite offices used for the
calculation of the satellite office allocation for any educational service
unit shall equal the difference of the ratio of the number of square miles
within the boundaries of the educational service unit divided by four thousand
minus one with the result rounded to the closest whole number.</para>
<para>(d) The statewide adjusted valuation shall equal the total
adjusted valuation for all member districts of educational service units pursuant
to section 79-1016 used for the calculation of state aid for school districts
pursuant to the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act for the
school fiscal year for which the distribution is being calculated pursuant
to this section.</para>
<para>(e) The adjusted valuation for each educational service unit
shall equal the total adjusted valuation of the member school districts pursuant
to section 79-1016 used for the calculation of state aid for school districts
pursuant to the act for the school fiscal year for which the distribution
is being calculated pursuant to this section, except that such adjusted valuation
for member school districts that are also member districts of a learning community
shall be reduced by fifty percent for school fiscal years
2008-09 and 2009-10, thirty percent for school fiscal year 2010-11, and ten
percent for each school fiscal year thereafter. The adjusted valuation
for each learning community shall equal fifty percent, for school fiscal years 2008-09 and 2009-10, thirty percent,
for school fiscal year 2010-11, and ten percent, for each school fiscal year
thereafter,  of the total adjusted valuation of the member school
districts pursuant to section 79-1016 used for the calculation of state aid
for school districts pursuant to the act for the school fiscal year for which

<para>(f) The local effort rate shall equal $0.0135 per one hundred
dollars of adjusted valuation.</para>
<para>(g) The statewide student allocation
shall equal the difference of the sum of the amount appropriated for distribution
pursuant to this section plus the product of the statewide adjusted valuation
multiplied by the local effort rate minus the distance education and telecommunications
allowance, base allocation, and satellite office allocation for all educational
service units and minus any adjustments required by
subsection (5) of this section.</para>
<para>(h) The sparsity adjustment for each educational service
unit and learning community shall equal the sum of one plus one-tenth of the
ratio of the square miles within the boundaries of the educational service
unit divided by the fall membership of the member school districts for the
school fiscal year immediately preceding the school fiscal year for which
the distribution is being calculated pursuant to this section.</para>
<para>(i) The adjusted students for each educational service unit
shall equal the fall membership for the school fiscal year immediately preceding

districts that will not be members of a learning community and fifty percent, for school fiscal years 2008-09 and
2009-10, seventy percent, for school fiscal year 2010-11, and ninety percent,
for each school fiscal year thereafter, of the fall membership
for such school fiscal year of the member school districts that will be members
of a learning community pursuant to this section multiplied by the sparsity
adjustment for the educational service unit, and the adjusted students for
each learning community shall equal fifty percent, for school fiscal years 2008-09 and 2009-10, thirty percent,
for school fiscal year 2010-11, and ten percent, for each school fiscal year
thereafter, of the fall membership for such school fiscal year
of the member school districts multiplied by the sparsity adjustment for the
learning community.</para>
<para>(j) The per student allocation shall equal the statewide
student allocation divided by the total adjusted students for all educational
service units and learning communities.</para>
<para>(k) The student allocation for each educational service unit
and learning community shall equal the per student allocation multiplied by
the adjusted students for the educational service unit or learning community.</para>
<para>(l) The needs for each educational service unit shall equal
the sum of the distance education and telecommunications allowance, base allocation,
satellite office allocation, and student allocation for the educational service
unit and the needs for each learning community shall equal the student allocation
for the learning community.</para>
<para>(m) The distribution of core services and technology infrastructure
funds for each educational service unit and learning community shall equal
the needs for each educational service unit or learning community minus the
product of the adjusted valuation for the educational service unit or learning
community multiplied by the local effort rate.</para>
<para>(3) If an educational service unit is the result of a merger
or received new member school districts from another educational service unit, the educational service unit shall be considered a new educational
service unit for purposes of this section. For each new educational service
unit, the needs minus the distance education and telecommunications allowance
for such new educational service unit shall, for each of the three
fiscal years following the fiscal year in which the merger takes place or
the new member school districts are received, equal an amount not less than
the needs minus the distance education and telecommunications
allowance for the portions of the educational service units transferred to
the new educational service unit for the fiscal year immediately
preceding the merger or receipt of new member school districts, except that
if the total amount available to be distributed pursuant to subsections (2)
through (6) of this section for the year for
which needs are being calculated is less than the total amount
distributed pursuant to such subsections for the fiscal year immediately preceding the
merger or receipt of new member school districts, the minimum needs minus
the distance education and telecommunications allowance for each
educational service unit pursuant to this subsection shall be reduced
by a percentage equal to the ratio of such difference divided by
the total amount distributed pursuant to subsections (2) through (6)
of this section for the fiscal year immediately preceding the merger or
receipt of new member school districts. The needs minus the distance education
and telecommunications allowance for the portions of educational service units
transferred to the new educational service unit for the fiscal
year immediately preceding a merger or receipt of new member school districts shall
equal the needs minus the distance education and
telecommunications allowance calculated for such fiscal year pursuant
to subsections (2) through (6)
of this section for any
educational service unit affected by the merger or the transfer of school
districts multiplied by a ratio equal to the valuation that was transferred
to the new educational service unit
for which the minimum is being calculated divided by the total valuation of
the educational service unit transferring the territory.</para>
<para>(4) For fiscal years 2010-11 through 2013-14, each
educational service unit shall have
needs minus the distance education and telecommunications allowance equal
to an amount not less than ninety-five percent of the needs minus the distance
education and telecommunications allowance for the immediately preceding fiscal
year, except that if the total amount available to be distributed
pursuant to subsections (2) through (6)
of this section for the year for which needs are being calculated is
less than the total amount distributed pursuant to such subsections for the immediately preceding fiscal
year, the minimum needs minus the distance education and telecommunications
allowance for each educational service unit pursuant to this subsection shall be reduced by a percentage
equal to the ratio of such difference divided by
the total amount distributed pursuant to subsections (2) through (6)
of this section.</para>
<para>(5) If the minimum needs minus the distance education and
telecommunications allowance pursuant to subsection (3) or (4)
of this section for any educational service unit exceeds the
amount that would otherwise be calculated for such
educational service unit pursuant to subsection (2) of this section,
the statewide student allocation shall be reduced such that the total amount
to be distributed pursuant to this section equals the appropriation for core
services and technology infrastructure funds and no educational service unit has needs minus the distance education and telecommunications
allowance less than the greater of any minimum amounts calculated
for such educational service unit pursuant to subsections (3)
and (4) of this section.</para>
<para>(6) The State Department of Education shall certify the distribution
of core services and technology infrastructure funds pursuant to subsections (2) through (6) of this section
to each educational service unit and learning community on or before July
1 of each year for the following
school fiscal year. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
any funds appropriated for distribution pursuant to this section
shall be distributed in ten as nearly as possible equal payments on the first
business day of each month beginning in September of each school fiscal year
and ending in June. Funds to
be distributed to a learning community in school fiscal year 2010-11 shall
be distributed in ten payments on the first business day of each month beginning
in September 2010 and ending in June 2011, with each of the first five payments
equal as nearly as possible to seventeen percent of the amount to be distributed
and with each of the last five payments equal as nearly as possible to three
percent of the amount to be distributed. Funds distributed to
educational service units pursuant to this section shall be used for core
services and technology infrastructure with the approval of representatives
of two-thirds of the member school districts of the educational service unit,
representing a majority of the adjusted students in the member school districts
used in calculations pursuant to this section for such funds. The valuation of individual school districts shall not be
considered in the utilization of such core services or technology infrastructure
funds by member school districts for funds received after July 1, 2010. Funds
distributed to learning communities on
or before January 15, 2011, shall be used for learning community
purposes with the approval of the learning community
coordinating council. Funds
distributed to learning communities after January 15, 2011, shall be used
for evaluation and research pursuant to section 79-2104.02 with the approval
of the learning community coordinating council.</para>
<para>(7) For
purposes of this section, the determination of whether or not a school district
will be a member of an educational service unit or a learning community shall
be based on the information available May 1 for the following school fiscal
year.</para>
