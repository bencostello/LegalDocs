time allowance; calculation.</catchline><para>(1)(a) For state aid calculated for school fiscal years
through school fiscal year 2012-13, the department shall calculate
an instructional time allowance for each district which submits the information
required for the calculation on a form prescribed by the department on or
before October 15 of the school fiscal year preceding the school fiscal year
for which aid is being calculated. The instructional time allowance shall
be equal to the product of the formula students of such district multiplied
by the instructional time factor for such district multiplied by eighty-five
percent of the statewide average general fund operating expenditures per formula
student.</para>
<para>(b) The instructional time
factor shall equal the difference of the ratio of the district's average hours
of instruction for each full-time student during the regular school year for
the most recently available complete data year divided by the statewide average
hours of instruction for each full-time student during the regular school
year for the most recently available complete data year minus one, except
that if the result is less than zero, the instructional time factor shall
equal zero.</para>
<para>(c) The average hours of instruction
shall be defined by the department and shall be based on scheduled time for
courses and the number of students participating in such courses as reported
to the department for the most recently available complete data year. Hours
of instruction shall not include extracurricular activities outside of the
regular school day or time designated for students to eat lunch. The statewide
average hours of instruction for each student shall be an average of the averages
for all school districts.</para>
<para>(2)(a) For
state aid calculated for school fiscal year 2013-14 and each school fiscal
year thereafter, the department shall calculate an instructional time allowance
for a school district if the average days in session for such school district
exceeds one hundred seventy-five days for the most recently available complete
data year.</para><para>(b) For purposes of this subsection:</para><para>(i) The allowance student
days for each qualifying school district shall equal the formula students
for such district multiplied by the difference of the average days in session
for such school district minus one hundred seventy-five days;</para>
<para>(ii) The average
days in session for each school district shall equal a weighted average of
the days in session for all schools in the school district as defined by the
department; and</para><para>(iii) The statewide allowance student days shall equal the sum
of the allowance student days for all qualifying school districts.</para>
<para>(c) The instructional
time allowance for each qualifying school district shall equal the product
of twenty million dollars multiplied by the ratio of the allowance student
days for such school district divided by the statewide allowance student days.</para>
<para>(d) Fifty
percent of the instructional time allowance calculated pursuant to this subsection
for each qualifying school district shall be paid to such school district
as instructional time aid for the school fiscal year for which aid is being
calculated.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2008, LB988, &#167; 25; </para><para>Laws 2009, LB545, &#167; 10; </para><para>Laws 2009, First Spec.
