Such investments shall not be made for speculation but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived. The trustees shall not purchase investments on margin or enter into any futures contract or other contract obligation which requires the payment of margin or enter into any similar contractual arrangement which may result in losses in excess of the amount paid or deposited with respect to such investment or contract, unless such transaction constitutes a hedging transaction or is incurred for the purpose of portfolio or risk management for the funds and investments of the system. The trustees may write covered call options or put options. The trustees shall establish written guidelines for any such option, purchase, or contract obligation. Any such option, purchase, or contract obligation shall be governed by the prudent investment rule stated in this section for investment of the funds of the system. The trustees may lend any security if cash, United States Government obligations, or United States Government agency obligations with a market value equal to or exceeding the market value of the security lent are received as collateral. If shares of stock are purchased under this section, all proxies may be voted by the trustees.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1989, LB 237, &#167; 6; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1994), &#167; 79-1051.07; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 900, &#167; 646; </para><para>Laws 1997, LB 624, &#167; 26. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
