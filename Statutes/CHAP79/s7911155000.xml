a student achievement coordinator, subject to confirmation by a majority vote
of the members of the State Board of Education. The coordinator shall have
a background and training in addressing the unique educational needs of low-achieving
students, including students in poverty, limited English proficient students,
and highly mobile students. The coordinator shall evaluate and coordinate
existing resources for effective programs to increase achievement for such
students across the state and shall review poverty plans submitted to the
State Department of Education pursuant to section 79-1013 and limited English
proficiency plans submitted to the department pursuant to section 79-1014
to ascertain successful practices being used by school districts in Nebraska
and to assist school districts in improving their poverty and limited English
proficiency plans, including the evaluation components. The coordinator need
not review the poverty and limited English proficiency plans of each school
district on an annual basis but shall develop a review schedule which assures
that plans are reviewed periodically.</para>
