test; report.</catchline><para>Beginning with the 2011-12 school year, the
State Department of Education may implement a three-year pilot project for
the districtwide administration of a standard college admission test, selected
by the State Board of Education, to students in the eleventh grade attending
a public school in a participating school district to determine if such test
(1) would improve the college-going rate and career readiness of Nebraska
students and (2) could be utilized as the assessment for the one grade in
high school as required under section 79-760.03. Participation by school districts
in the pilot project shall be voluntary and shall be subject to the approval
of the board. On or before September 1, 2012, and on or before September 1
each year thereafter through 2014, the department shall report to the Governor,
the Clerk of the Legislature, and the chairperson of the Education Committee
of the Legislature on the pilot project. The
report submitted to the Clerk of the Legislature and the committee shall be
submitted electronically. The project shall be paid for with funds
from the Education Innovation Fund as provided in section 9-812.</para>
