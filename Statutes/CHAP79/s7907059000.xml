with the 2011-12 school year, the State Department of Education may implement
a pilot
project for the districtwide administration of a standard college admission
test, selected by the State Board of Education, to students in the eleventh
grade attending a public school in a participating school district to determine
if such test (1) would improve the college-going rate and career readiness
of Nebraska students and (2) could be utilized as the assessment for the one
grade in high school as required under section 79-760.03. Participation by
school districts in the pilot project shall be voluntary and shall be subject
to the approval of the board. On or before September 1, 2012, and on or before
September 1 each year thereafter through 2016, the department shall
report to the Governor, the Clerk of the Legislature, and the chairperson
of the Education Committee of the Legislature on the pilot project. The report
submitted to the Clerk of the Legislature and the committee shall be submitted
electronically. The project
shall continue through school year 2015-16. The project shall
be paid for with funds from the Education Innovation Fund as provided in section
9-812.</para>
