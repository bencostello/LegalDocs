Except as provided in section 79-240, the school board of the option school
district shall adopt by resolution specific standards for acceptance and rejection
of applications. Standards may include the capacity of a program, class, grade
level, or school building or the availability of appropriate special education
programs operated by the option school district.
Capacity shall be determined by setting a maximum number of option students
that a district will accept in any program, class, grade level, or school
building, based upon available staff, facilities, projected enrollment of
resident students, projected number of students with which the option school district will contract
based on existing contractual arrangements, and availability of appropriate
special education programs. The school board of the option school district
may by resolution declare a program, a class, or a school unavailable to option
students due to lack of capacity. Standards shall not include previous academic
achievement, athletic or other extracurricular ability, disabilities, proficiency
in the English language, or previous disciplinary proceedings except as provided
in section 79-266.01. False
or substantively misleading information submitted by a parent or guardian
on an application to an option school district may be cause for the option
school district to reject a previously accepted application if the rejection
occurs prior to the student's attendance as an option student.</para>

board of every school district shall also adopt standards and conditions for
acceptance or rejection of a request for release of a resident student submitting
an application to an option school district after March 15 under subsection
(1) of section 79-237.</para><para>(3) Any
option school district shall give first priority for enrollment to siblings
of option students, except that the option school district shall not be required

(1) of section 79-240.</para>
<para>(4) Any option school district
that is in a learning community shall give second priority for enrollment
to students who reside in the learning community and who contribute to the
socioeconomic diversity of enrollment as defined in section 79-2110 at the
