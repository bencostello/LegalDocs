education allowance; calculation.</catchline><para>The department
shall calculate a teacher education allowance for each district as follows:</para>
<para>(1) Teacher education points shall be calculated for each
district by the department based upon data from the fall personnel report
required pursuant to section 79-804 for the school fiscal year immediately
preceding the school fiscal year in which aid is to be paid. Each full-time
equivalent teacher shall (a) be under contract with a school district as required
pursuant to section 79-818 and (b) only be counted one time in awarding any
points pursuant to this section. Each district shall receive one point for
each full-time equivalent teacher who has earned and been awarded a master's
degree or an education specialist's degree and two points for each full-time
equivalent teacher who has earned and been awarded a doctoral degree;</para>
<para>(2) For school fiscal years prior to school
fiscal year 2013-14, a teacher education index shall be calculated
for each district by dividing the ratio of teacher education points for the
district divided by the number of full-time equivalent teachers in the district
by the ratio of teacher education points for all districts divided by the
number of full-time equivalent teachers in all districts;</para>
<para>(3) For school fiscal years prior to school
fiscal year 2013-14, the teacher education allowance for each
district shall equal eight and one-half percent of the statewide average general
fund operating expenditures per formula student multiplied by the district's
formula students and multiplied by the difference of the product of the district's
teacher education index minus one, except that if the result is less than
zero, the teacher education allowance shall equal zero; and</para>
<para>(4) For school
fiscal year 2013-14 and each school fiscal year thereafter, the teacher education
allowance for each district shall equal the product of thirty million dollars
multiplied by the ratio of teacher education points calculated for the district
divided by the aggregate teacher education points calculated for all districts.
Fifty percent of the teacher education allowance calculated pursuant to this
subdivision for each school district shall be paid to such school district
as teacher education aid for the school fiscal year for which aid is being
calculated.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2009, First Spec. Sess., LB5, &#167; 8; </para><para>Laws 2013, LB407, &#167; 10.</para><effectivedate>May 22, 2013</effectivedate></source>  </law>
