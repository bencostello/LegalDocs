degree and two points for each full-time equivalent teacher who has earned
and been awarded a doctoral degree;</para><para>(2) A teacher education index shall be calculated
for each district by dividing the ratio of teacher education points for the

by the ratio of teacher education points for all districts divided by the
number of full-time equivalent teachers in all districts; and</para>
<para>(3) The teacher education
allowance for each district shall equal eight and one-half percent of the
statewide average general fund operating expenditures per formula student

of the product of the district's teacher education index minus one, except
that if the result is less than zero, the teacher education allowance shall
equal zero.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2009, First Spec. Sess., LB5, &#167; 8.</para></source>  </law>
