Chief emphasis in such summer classes shall be on reading, language arts, and arithmetic and those areas of personality development especially in need of development. Teachers shall be encouraged to design new and imaginative techniques and curricula not usually used during the regular school year which in the opinion of such teachers will offer new incentives towards learning, with special emphasis on those techniques that seek to develop the students' personalities in a wholesome manner, especially developing pride, self-confidence, and self-control. Teachers of such classes shall not be assigned more than fifteen students, or more than twenty-five students if assisted full time by an aide or paraprofessional. Such students shall be graded at the end of the course upon their relative degree of striving to improve their skills, attitudes, and personalities.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1969, c. 699, &#167; 1, p. 2698; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1994), &#167; 79-1001.02; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 900, &#167; 289; </para><para>Laws 2006, LB 1024, &#167; 54.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
