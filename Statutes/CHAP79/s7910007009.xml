<para>(2) The department shall determine the limited English proficiency

include in the limited English proficiency allowance expenditures those expenditures that are not included in other allowances, that
were used to specifically address issues related to the education of students
with limited English proficiency or to the implementation of the limited English
proficiency plan, that do not replace expenditures that would have occurred
if the students involved in the program did not have limited English proficiency, and
that are paid for with noncategorical funds generated by state or local taxes

the school district shall also be disqualified from receiving a limited English
proficiency allowance for the school fiscal year for which aid is being calculated.
Any limited English proficiency allowance correction calculated pursuant to
