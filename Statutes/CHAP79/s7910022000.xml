On or before March 10, 2010, and
March 1, 2011, for school fiscal year 2010-11, on or before July 1, 2011,
for school fiscal year 2011-12, and on or before March 1 of each
year thereafter for each ensuing
fiscal year, the department shall determine the amounts to be
distributed to each local system and each district pursuant to the Tax Equity
and Educational Opportunities Support Act and shall certify the amounts to
the Director of Administrative Services, the Auditor of Public Accounts, each
learning community, and each district. The amount to be distributed to each
district that is not a member of a learning community from the amount certified
for a local system shall be proportional based on the formula students attributed to each district
in the local system. The amount to be distributed to each district that is
a member of a learning community from the amount certified for the local system
shall be proportional based on the formula needs calculated for each district
in the local system. On or before March 1, 2011, for school fiscal year 2010-11, on or before
July 1, 2011, for school fiscal year 2011-12, and on or before
March 1 of each year thereafter for
each ensuing fiscal year, the department shall report the necessary
funding level to the Governor, the Appropriations Committee of the Legislature,
and the Education Committee of the Legislature. Except
as otherwise provided in this subsection, certified state aid
amounts, including adjustments pursuant to section 79-1065.02, shall be shown
as budgeted non-property-tax receipts and deducted prior to calculating the
property tax request in the district's general fund budget statement as provided
to the Auditor of Public Accounts pursuant to section 79-1024. Increases in state aid for school fiscal year 2010-11 from
the first certification in 2010 to the second certification on or before March
1, 2011, shall not require a school district to revise its previously adopted
budget statement pursuant to section 13-511 for school fiscal year 2010-11
unless expenditures are increased in such school fiscal year as a result of
such increases in state aid. The amount of such increased state aid that has
not been included in an amended budget for school fiscal year 2010-11 shall
be included in the unencumbered cash balance pursuant to section 13-504 for
the school fiscal year 2011-12 budget for each school district.</para>
<para>(2) Except as provided in this
subsection, subsection (8) of section 79-1016, and sections 79-1033 and 79-1065.02, the amounts
certified pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall be distributed
in ten as nearly as possible equal payments on the last business day of each
month beginning in September of each ensuing school fiscal year and ending
in June of the following year, except that when a school district is to receive
a monthly payment of less than one thousand dollars, such payment shall be
one lump-sum payment on the last business day of December during the ensuing
school fiscal year. For school
fiscal year 2010-11, payments shall be based on the amounts certified pursuant
to subsection (1) of this section on March 10, 2010, except that on the last
business day of April, the department shall make federal Education Jobs Fund
allocations available pursuant to section 79-1028.04 equal to any increases
in state aid for school fiscal year 2010-11 from the first certification in
2010 to the second certification on or before March 1, 2011, rounded to the
nearest whole dollar.</para>
