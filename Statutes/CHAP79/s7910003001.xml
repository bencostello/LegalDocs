allowance; summer school student units; calculations.</catchline><para>(1) The department shall calculate
a summer school allowance for each district which submits the information
required for the calculation on a form prescribed by the department on or
before October 15 of the school fiscal year preceding the school fiscal year
for which aid is being calculated. A summer school allowance shall be equal
to two and one-half percent of the summer school student units for such district
multiplied by eighty-five percent of the statewide average general fund operating
expenditures per formula student.</para>
<para>(2) Summer school student
units shall be calculated for each student enrolled in summer school as defined in section 79-536 in
a school district who attends such summer school for at least twelve days in the most recently available complete
data year, whether or not the student is in the membership of
the school district. The initial number of units for each such student shall
equal the sum of the ratios, each rounded down to the nearest whole number,
of the number of days for which the student attended summer school classes
in such district for at least three hours and less than six hours per day
divided by twelve days and of two times the number of days for which the student
attended summer school classes in such district for six or more hours per
day divided by twelve days.</para>
<para>(3) Each school district shall receive an additional summer
school student unit for each summer school student unit attributed to remedial
math or reading programs. Each school district shall also receive an additional
summer school student unit for each summer school student unit attributed
to a free lunch and free milk student.</para>
<para>(4) Beginning
with state aid calculated for school fiscal year 2012-13, summer school student
units shall be calculated for each student who was both enrolled in the most
recently available complete data year in a summer session of an early childhood
education program for which a qualified early childhood education fall membership
greater than zero has been calculated for the school fiscal year for which
aid is being calculated and eligible to attend kindergarten in the fall immediately
following such summer session. The initial number of units for each such early
childhood education student shall equal the sum of the ratios, each rounded
down to the nearest whole number, of the number of days for which the student
attended the summer session in such district for at least three hours and
less than six hours per day divided by twelve days and of two times the number
of days for which the student attended the summer session in such district
for six or more hours per day divided by twelve days. The initial summer school
student units for early childhood education students shall be multiplied by
six-tenths. Instructional hours included in the calculation of the qualified
early childhood education fall membership or the qualified early childhood
education average daily membership shall not be included in the calculation
of the summer school allowance.</para><para>(5) Each school district shall receive
an additional six-tenths of a summer school student unit for each early childhood
education student unit attributed to a free lunch and free milk early childhood
education student.</para><para>(6) This
section does not prevent school districts from requiring and collecting fees
for summer school or summer
sessions of early childhood education programs, except that summer
school student units shall not be calculated for school districts which collect
fees for summer school from students who qualify for free or reduced-price
lunches under United States Department of Agriculture child nutrition programs.</para>
