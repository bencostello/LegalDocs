The beginning point of the range shall be assigned a number equal to the maximum allowable growth rate established in section 79-1025, and the end point of the range shall be assigned a number equal to the basic allowable growth rate as prescribed in such section such that the lower end of the range shall be assigned the maximum allowable growth rate and the higher end of the range shall be assigned the basic allowable growth rate; and</para><para>(2) For each school fiscal year, each local system's general fund operating expenditures shall be compared to its target budget level along the range described in subdivision (1) of this section to arrive at an applicable allowable growth rate as follows: If each local system's general fund operating expenditures fall below the lower end of the range, such applicable allowable growth rate shall be the maximum growth rate identified in section 79-1025.

If each local system's general fund operating expenditures fall between the lower end and the higher end of the range, the department shall use a linear interpolation calculation between the end points of the range to arrive at the applicable allowable growth rate for the local system.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1990, LB 1059, &#167; 17; </para><para>Laws 1991, LB 511, &#167; 82; </para><para>Laws 1992, LB 245, &#167; 87; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 299, &#167; 29; </para><para>R.S.1943, (1994), &#167; 79-3817; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 900, &#167; 672; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 1050, &#167; 31; </para><para>Laws 1997, LB 710, &#167; 15; </para><para>Laws 1997, LB 806, &#167; 52; </para><para>Laws 1998, LB 989, &#167; 10; </para><para>Laws 1999, LB 149, &#167; 11; </para><para>Laws 1999, LB 813, &#167; 25; </para><para>Laws 2001, LB 797, &#167; 27; </para><para>Laws 2003, LB 67, &#167; 15; </para><para>Laws 2003, LB 540, &#167; 8; </para><para>Laws 2005, LB 126, &#167; 48; </para><para>Laws 2006, LB 1024, &#167; 88; </para><para>Referendum 2006, No. 422; </para><para>Laws 2007, LB21, &#167; 4.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
