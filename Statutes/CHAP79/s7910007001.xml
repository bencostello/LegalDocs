The department shall calculate a ratio of the formula students to the total children under nineteen years of age residing in the local system and shall apply the ratio to the low-income children within the local system, in order to determine the number of low-income students within such local system. The number of children under nineteen years of age used in this calculation shall be derived from income tax information. The poverty factor shall equal the number of low-income students or the formula students qualified for free lunches or free milk under United States Department of Agriculture child nutrition programs, whichever is greater, multiplied by the following factors:</para><para>(A) 0 for the qualified formula students comprising the first five percent of the formula students in the local system;</para><para>(B) 0.05 for the qualified formula students comprising more than five percent and not more than ten percent of the formula students in the local system;</para><para>(C) 0.10 for the qualified formula students comprising more than ten percent and not more than fifteen percent of the formula students in the local system;</para><para>(D) 0.15 for the qualified formula students comprising more than fifteen percent and not more than twenty percent of the formula students in the local system;</para><para>(E) 0.20 for the qualified formula students comprising more than twenty percent and not more than twenty-five percent of the formula students in the local system;</para><para>(F) 0.25 for the qualified formula students comprising more than twenty-five percent and not more than thirty percent of the formula students in the local system; and</para><para>(G) 0.30 for the qualified formula students comprising more than thirty percent of the formula students in the local system; and</para><para>(iv) The extreme remoteness factor shall equal 0.125 times the formula students in the local system for each local system that has fewer than two hundred formula students, more than six hundred square miles in the local system, less than three-tenths formula student per square mile in the local system, and more than twenty-five miles between the high school attendance center and the next closest high school attendance center on paved roads; and </para><para>(2) The total adjusted formula students for each local system shall equal the weighted formula students plus the demographic factors, except that (a) for local systems qualifying for the extreme remoteness factor, the total adjusted formula students shall be greater than or equal to one hundred fifty adjusted formula students, (b) the total adjusted formula students for a local system shall not include the extreme remoteness factor or any adjustment to the adjusted formula students resulting from qualification for the extreme remoteness factor for the calculation of the average formula cost per student in each cost grouping pursuant to subdivision (2) of section 79-1007.02, and (c) the total adjusted formula students for a local system shall include the extreme remoteness factor and any adjustment to the adjusted formula students resulting from qualification for the extreme remoteness factor for the calculation of the local system's formula need pursuant to subdivision (3) of section 79-1007.02.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1997, LB 710, &#167; 9; </para><para>Laws 1997, LB 806, &#167; 35; </para><para>Laws 1998, Spec.
