The issues to be examined are: (1) A review of Laws 1996, LB 108, to determine what, if any, changes are needed to adequately address Nebraska's conjunctive use management issues; (2) an evaluation of the utility of allowing temporary water transfers and, if deemed useful, development of draft legislation and procedures for authorizing and implementing a temporary water transfer law; (3) an evaluation of the utility of authorizing additional types of permanent water transfers and, if deemed useful, development of draft legislation and procedures for authorizing and implementing additional types of permanent water transfers; (4) a determination as to the usefulness of water leasing or transfers and development of a potential water banking system that would facilitate the temporary or permanent transfer of water uses; and (5) a determination as to what other ways, if any, inequities between surface water users and ground water users need to be addressed and potential actions the state could take to address any such inequities. To address such issues, the Governor shall appoint a Water Policy Task Force as provided in section 46-2,132.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2002, LB 1003, &#167; 1. </para><terminationdate>December 31, 2009</terminationdate></source></law></legaldoc>
