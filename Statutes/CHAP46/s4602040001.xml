To accomplish such purpose, existing agricultural appropriators within the drainage basin having less than the statutory limit of direct flow shall, as a matter of right, be entitled upon application therefor to the approval and grant of such additional supplemental appropriation or appropriations from the direct flow of such stream as will not make the total appropriations, for the lands upon which such water is to be used, exceed the limits provided by law and as may be necessary and required for the production of crops upon such lands with the practice of good husbandry. Applications for such supplemental additional appropriations from the direct flow, upon the approval or granting thereof, shall have priority within the drainage basin as of the date such applications are filed in the office of the department.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1953, c. 160, &#167; 1, p. 503; </para><para>Laws 2000, LB 900, &#167; 114. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
