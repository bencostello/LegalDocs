<para>(MBCA 8.70) (a) A director's
taking advantage, directly or indirectly, of a business opportunity may not
be the subject of equitable relief or give rise to an award of damages or
other sanctions against the director in a proceeding by or in the right of
the corporation on the ground that such opportunity should have first been
offered to the corporation if before becoming legally obligated respecting
the opportunity the director brings it to the attention of the corporation
and:</para>
<para>(1) Action by qualified
directors disclaiming the corporation's interest in the opportunity is taken
in compliance with the procedures set forth in section 21-2,122, as if the
decision being made concerned a director's conflicting interest transaction;
or</para><para>(2)
Shareholders' action disclaiming the corporation's interest in the opportunity
is taken in compliance with the procedures set forth in section 21-2,123,
as if the decision being made concerned a director's conflicting interest
transaction, except that rather than making required disclosure as defined
in section 21-2,120, in each case the director shall have made prior disclosure
to those acting on behalf of the corporation of all material facts concerning
the business opportunity that are then known to the director.</para>
<para>(b) In any proceeding
seeking equitable relief or other remedies based upon an alleged improper
taking advantage of a business opportunity by a director, the fact that the
director did not employ the procedure described in subsection (a) of this
section before taking advantage of the opportunity shall not create an inference
that the opportunity should have been first presented to the corporation or
alter the burden of proof otherwise applicable to establish that the director
breached a duty to the corporation in the circumstances.</para>
