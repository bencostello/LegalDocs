directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other
special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case
the board of directors shall transmit to the shareholders the basis for that
determination.</para><para>(3) The domestic corporation shall notify each shareholder of the
domestic corporation, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders
