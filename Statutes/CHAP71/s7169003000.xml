<para>(1) The requirements
and procedures under this section are available to pregnant women whether
or not they are residents of this state.</para><para>(2) If a pregnant woman elects not to obtain the consent of her parents or guardians, a
judge of a district court, separate juvenile court, or county court sitting
as a juvenile court shall, upon petition or motion and after an appropriate
hearing, authorize a physician to perform the abortion if the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that
the pregnant woman is both
sufficiently mature and well-informed
to decide whether to have an abortion. If the court does not make the finding
specified in this subsection or subsection (3) of this section, it shall dismiss
the petition.</para>
<para>(3) If the
court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that there is evidence of abuse
as defined in section 28-351, sexual abuse as defined in section 28-367, or
child abuse or neglect as defined in section 28-710 of the pregnant woman
by a parent or a guardian or that an abortion without the consent of a parent
or a guardian is in the best interest of the pregnant woman, the court shall
issue an order authorizing the pregnant woman to consent to the performance
or inducement of an abortion without the consent of a parent or a guardian.
If the court does not make the finding specified in this subsection or subsection
(2) of this section, it shall dismiss the petition.</para><para>(4) A facsimile copy of the

<para>(5) A court shall not be required
to have a facsimile machine nor shall the court be required to transmit orders
or other material to attorneys or parties via facsimile transmission.</para>
<para>(6) The pregnant woman may commence an action
for waiver of the
consent requirement by the filing of a petition or motion personally,
by mail, or by facsimile on a form provided by the State Court Administrator.</para>
<para>(7) The State Court Administrator
shall develop the petition form and accompanying instructions on the procedure
for petitioning the court for a waiver of consent, including the name,
address, telephone number, and facsimile number of each court in the state.
A sufficient number of petition forms and instructions shall be made available
in each courthouse in such place that members of the general public may obtain
a form and instructions without requesting such form and instructions from
the clerk of the court or other court personnel. The clerk of the court shall,
upon request, assist in completing and filing the petition for waiver of consent.</para>
<para>(8) Proceedings in court pursuant
to this section shall be confidential and
shall ensure the anonymity of the pregnant woman. The pregnant woman shall
have the right to file her petition in the court using a pseudonym or using
solely her initials. Proceedings shall be held in camera. Only
the pregnant woman, the pregnant woman's guardian ad litem, the pregnant woman's
attorney, and a person whose presence is specifically requested by the pregnant
woman or the pregnant woman's attorney may attend
the hearing on the petition. All testimony, all documents, all other evidence
presented to the court, the petition and any order entered, and all records
of any nature and kind relating to the matter shall be sealed by the clerk
of the court and shall not be open to any person except upon order of the
court for good cause shown. A separate docket for the purposes of this section

subject to this section may participate in the court proceedings on her own
behalf, and the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for her. The court shall
advise the pregnant woman that she has a right to court-appointed counsel
and shall, upon her request, provide her with such counsel. Such counsel shall
receive a fee to be fixed by the court and to be paid out of the treasury
of the county in which the proceeding was held.</para>
<para>(10) Proceedings in court
pursuant to this section shall be given such precedence over other pending
matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay
to serve the best interest of the pregnant woman.
In no case shall the court fail to rule within seven calendar days from the
time the petition is filed. If the court fails to rule within the required
time period, the pregnant woman may file an application for a writ of mandamus
with the Supreme Court. If cause for a writ of mandamus exists, the writ shall
issue within three days.</para>
<para>(11) The court shall issue
a written order which includes specific factual findings and legal conclusions
supporting its decision which shall be provided immediately to the pregnant
woman, the pregnant woman's guardian ad litem, the pregnant woman's attorney,
and any other person designated by the pregnant woman to receive the order.
Further, the court shall order that a confidential record of the evidence
and the judge's findings and conclusions be maintained. At the hearing, the
court shall hear evidence relating to the emotional development, maturity,
intellect, and understanding of the pregnant woman.</para>
