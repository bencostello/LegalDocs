waiver of licensing standard; when; department; report.</catchline><para>(1) The department shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
pursuant to sections 71-1901 to 71-1906.01 for (a) the proper care and protection
of children by licensees under such sections, (b) the issuance, suspension,
and revocation of licenses to provide foster care, (c) the issuance, suspension,
and revocation of probationary licenses to provide foster care, (d) the issuance,
suspension, and revocation of provisional licenses to provide foster care,
(e) the provision of training in foster care, which training shall be directly
related to the skills necessary to care for children in need of out-of-home
care, including, but not limited to, abused, neglected, dependent, and delinquent
children, and (f) the proper administration of sections 71-1901 to 71-1906.01.</para>
<para>(2) The department may issue a waiver for any licensing standard
not related to children's safety for a relative home that is pursuing licensure. Such
waivers shall be granted on a case-by-case basis upon assessment by the department based
upon the best interests of the child. A relative home that receives a waiver
pursuant to this subsection shall be considered fully licensed for purposes
of federal reimbursement under the federal Fostering Connections to Success
and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, Public Law 110-351. The
department shall submit electronically an annual report to the Health and
Human Services Committee of the Legislature on the number of waivers granted
under this subsection and the total number of children placed in relative homes. For 2013 and 2014, the department shall provide the
report electronically to
the Health and Human Services Committee of the Legislature on or before September
15.</para>
<para>(3) The department shall
adopt and promulgate rules and regulations establishing new foster home licensing
requirements that ensure children's safety, health, and well-being but minimize
the use of licensing mandates for nonsafety issues. Such rules and regulations
shall provide alternatives to address nonsafety issues regarding housing and
provide assistance to families in overcoming licensing barriers, especially
in child-specific relative and kinship placements, to maximize appropriate
reimbursement under Title IV-E of the federal Social Security Act, as amended,
including expanding the use of kinship guardianship assistance payments under
42 U.S.C. 673(d), as such act and section existed on January 1, 2013.</para>
