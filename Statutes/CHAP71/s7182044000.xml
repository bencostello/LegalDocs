The department shall determine by rule and regulation the manner and form of such requests. Upon receiving a request, the department shall review the request to determine whether there is compliance with standards for the trauma care level for which designation is desired or whether the appropriate governing body verification documentation has been submitted. Any hospital, facility, rehabilitation center, or specialty level burn or pediatric trauma center which submits such verification documentation shall be designated by the department and shall be included in the trauma system or plan established under the Statewide Trauma System Act. Any medical facility applying for designation may appeal its designation. The appeal shall be in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.</para> <para>Designation is valid for a period of four years and is renewable upon receipt of a request from the medical facility for renewal prior to expiration. Any medical facility that is currently verified by its governing body shall be designated at the corresponding level of designation for the same time period in Nebraska without the necessity of an onsite review by the department. Regional trauma advisory boards shall be notified promptly of designated medical facilities in their region so they may incorporate them into the regional plan. The department may revoke or suspend a designation if it determines that the medical facility is substantially out of compliance with the standards and has refused or been unable to comply after a reasonable period of time has elapsed. The department shall promptly notify the regional trauma advisory board of designation suspensions and revocations. Any rehabilitation or trauma center the designation of which has been revoked or suspended may request a hearing to review the action of the department.</para> </amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1997, LB 626, &#167; 44; </para><para>Laws 2009, LB195, &#167; 104.</para></source><crossreference><para><emphasis>Administrative Procedure Act,</emphasis> see section 84-920.</para></crossreference>  </law> </legaldoc>
