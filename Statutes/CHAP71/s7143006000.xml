If and when the duly authorized representative of the department upon inspection and investigation of a swimming pool considers that the conditions are such as to warrant prompt closing of such swimming pool until the provisions of sections 71-4301 to 71-4307 are complied with, he or she shall notify the owner or operator of the swimming pool to prohibit any person from using the swimming pool and upon such notification to the sheriff and the county attorney of the county in which such pool is located, it shall be the duty of such county attorney and sheriff to see that the notice of the representative of the department shall be enforced. If and when the owner or operator of the pool has, in the opinion of the department, met the provisions of sections 71-4301 to 71-4307, the department may in writing authorize the use again of such swimming pool.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1969, c. 760, &#167; 6, p. 2876; </para><para>Laws 1996, LB 1044, &#167; 673; </para><para>Laws 2007, LB296, &#167; 584.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
