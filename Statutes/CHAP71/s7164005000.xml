state agencies, including all state constitutional offices, state administrative
departments, and state boards and commissions, the University of Nebraska,
and the Nebraska state colleges, shall comply with the state building code.
No state agency may adopt, promulgate, or enforce any rule or regulation in
conflict with the state building code unless otherwise specifically authorized
by statute to adopt or enforce a building or construction code other than
the state building code. Nothing in the Building Construction Act shall authorize
any state agency to apply such act to manufactured homes or recreational vehicles
regulated by the Uniform Standard Code for Manufactured Homes and Recreational
Vehicles or to modular housing units regulated by the Nebraska Uniform Standards
for Modular Housing Units Act. A state agency may, by rule or regulation,
amend the state building code by adopting any supplement, new edition, or
appendix of the International Building Code (IBC), 2000 edition, International
Residential Code (IRC), 2000 edition, or the International Existing Building Code,
2009 Edition, referred to in section 71-6403, except that all
amendments shall be approved in advance by the Director of Administrative
Services. Amendments to the state building code may also include variations
from the code which will reduce unnecessary costs of construction, increase
safety, durability, or efficiency, or address special local conditions within
the state.</para>
