state agencies, including all state constitutional offices, state administrative
departments, and state boards and commissions, the University of Nebraska,
and the Nebraska state colleges, shall comply with the state building code.
No state agency may adopt, promulgate, or enforce any rule or regulation in
conflict with the state building code unless otherwise specifically authorized
by statute to adopt or enforce a building or construction code other than
the state building code. Nothing in the Building Construction Act shall authorize
any state agency to apply such act to manufactured homes or recreational vehicles
regulated by the Uniform Standard Code for Manufactured Homes and Recreational
Vehicles or to modular housing units regulated by the Nebraska Uniform Standards
for Modular Housing Units Act. A state agency may, by rule or regulation,
amend the state building code by adopting any supplement or appendix of the International
Building Code (IBC), 2009 edition, International
Residential Code (IRC), 2009 edition, or
the International Existing Building Code, 2009 edition, referred to in section
71-6403, except that all amendments shall be approved in advance by the Director
of Administrative Services. Amendments to the state building code may also
include variations from the code which will reduce unnecessary costs of construction,
increase safety, durability, or efficiency, or address special local conditions
within the state and may include
adoption of section R313 of the 2009 edition of the International Residential
Code.</para>
