Blind persons licensed by the commission pursuant to its rules and regulations are authorized to operate vending facilities in any federally owned building or on any federally owned or controlled property, in any state-owned building or on any property owned or controlled by the state, or on any property owned or controlled by any county, city, or municipality with the approval of the local governing body, when, in the judgment of the director of the commission, such vending facilities may be properly and satisfactorily operated by blind persons.
