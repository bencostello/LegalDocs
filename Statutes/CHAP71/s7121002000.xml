syndrome; legislative findings.</catchline><para>The Legislature
finds that shaken baby syndrome is the medical term used to describe the violent
shaking of an infant or child and the injuries or other results sustained
by the infant or child. The Legislature further finds that shaken baby syndrome
may occur when an infant or child is violently shaken as part of a pattern
of abuse or because an adult has momentarily succumbed to the frustration
of responding to a crying infant or child. The Legislature further finds that
these injuries can include brain swelling and damage, subdural hemorrhage, intellectual disability, or
death. The Legislature further finds and declares that there is a present
and growing need to provide programs aimed at reducing the number of cases
of shaken baby syndrome in Nebraska.</para>
