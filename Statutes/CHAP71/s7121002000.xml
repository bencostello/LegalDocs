The Legislature further finds that shaken baby syndrome may occur when an infant or child is violently shaken as part of a pattern of abuse or because an adult has momentarily succumbed to the frustration of responding to a crying infant or child. The Legislature further finds that these injuries can include brain swelling and damage, subdural hemorrhage, mental retardation, or death. The Legislature further finds and declares that there is a present and growing need to provide programs aimed at reducing the number of cases of shaken baby syndrome in Nebraska.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 2006, LB 994, &#167; 148.</para></source></law></legaldoc>
