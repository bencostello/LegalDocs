required; processing of application.</catchline><para>(1) In the event of
the transfer of ownership of a motorboat by operation of law as upon inheritance,
devise, or bequest, order in bankruptcy, insolvency, replevin, or execution
sale, (2) whenever a motorboat is sold to satisfy storage or repair charges,
or (3) whenever repossession is had upon default in performance of the terms
of a chattel mortgage, trust receipt, conditional sales contract, or other
like agreement, the county treasurer of any county or
the Department of Motor Vehicles, upon the surrender of the prior certificate
of title or the manufacturer's or importer's certificate, or when that is
not possible, upon presentation of satisfactory proof of ownership and right
of possession to the motorboat, and upon payment of the fee prescribed in
section 37-1287 and the presentation of an application for certificate of
title, may issue to the applicant a certificate of title thereto. If the prior
certificate of title issued for the motorboat provided for joint ownership
with right of survivorship, a new certificate of title shall be issued to
a subsequent purchaser upon the assignment of the prior certificate of title
by the surviving owner and presentation of satisfactory proof of death of
the deceased owner. Only an affidavit by the person or agent of the person
to whom possession of the motorboat has so passed, setting forth facts entitling
him or her to such possession and ownership, together with a copy of the journal
entry, court order, or instrument upon which such claim of possession and
ownership is founded shall be considered satisfactory proof of ownership and
right of possession, except that if the applicant cannot produce such proof
of ownership, he or she may submit to the department such evidence as he or
she may have and the department may thereupon, if it finds the evidence sufficient,
issue the certificate of title or authorize any county treasurer to issue a certificate
of title, as the case may be. If from the records of the county treasurer or the department
there appear to be any liens on the motorboat, the certificate of title shall
comply with section 37-1282 regarding the liens unless the application is
accompanied by proper evidence of their satisfaction or extinction.</para>
