procedure.</catchline><para>The owner of a homestead which has been granted
an exemption provided in sections 77-3506
and 77-3507 to 77-3509, who becomes the owner of another homestead
prior to August 15 during the year for which the exemption was granted, may
file an application with the county assessor of the county where the new homestead
is located, on or before August 15 of such year, for a transfer of the exemption
to the new homestead. The county assessor shall examine each application and
determine whether or not the new homestead, except for the January 1 through
August 15 ownership and occupancy requirement and the income requirements,
is eligible for exemption under sections 77-3506
and 77-3507 to 77-3509. If the application is approved by the
county assessor, he or she shall make a deduction upon the assessment rolls
using the same criteria as previously applied to the original homestead. The
county assessor may allow the application for transfer to also be considered
an application for a homestead exemption for the subsequent year.</para>
