redemption from sale; when and how made.</catchline><para>The owner
or occupant of any real property sold for taxes or any person having a lien
thereupon or interest therein may redeem the same. For owner-occupied real property, the right of redemption
expires forty-five days after the date of application for the tax deed, and
for all other real property, the right of redemption expires when the purchaser
files an application for tax deed with the county treasurer. A redemption
shall not be accepted by the county treasurer, or considered valid, unless
received prior to the close of business forty-five days after the date of
application for the tax deed for owner-occupied real property or prior to
the close of business on the day the application for the tax deed is received
by the county treasurer for other real property. Redemption shall be accomplished by paying the county treasurer for
the use of such purchaser or his or her heirs or assigns the sum mentioned
in his or her certificate, with interest thereon at the rate specified in
section 45-104.01, as such rate may from time to time be adjusted by the Legislature,
from the date of purchase to date of redemption, together with all other taxes
subsequently paid, whether for any year or years previous or subsequent to
the sale, and interest thereon at the same rate from date of such payment
to date of redemption. In addition,
if owner-occupied real property is redeemed after the day the purchaser files
an application for a tax deed, the owner shall pay a redemption fee equal
to twenty percent of all other amounts due.</para>
