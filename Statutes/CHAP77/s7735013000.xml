if an owner is granted a homestead exemption as provided in section 77-3506, 77-3507, or 77-3509 or subdivision
(1)(b)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of section 77-3508, no reapplication
need be filed for succeeding years, in which case the county assessor and
Tax Commissioner shall determine whether the claimant qualifies for the homestead
exemption in such succeeding years as otherwise provided in sections 77-3501
to 77-3529 as though a claim were made.</para>
<para>(2) It shall be the duty of each claimant who wants the homestead exemption
provided in subdivision (1)(b)(i) of section 77-3508 to file an application
therefor with the county assessor on or before June 30 of each year. Failure
to do so shall constitute a waiver of the exemption for such year, except
that:</para>
<para>(a) The county board of the county in which the homestead is located
may, by majority vote, extend the deadline for an applicant to on or before
July 20. An extension shall not be granted to an applicant who received an
extension in the immediately preceding year; and </para>
<para>(b) A claimant may file a late application pursuant to section 77-3514.01

the claimant's ability to file the application in a timely manner.</para>
<para>(3) The county assessor shall mail a notice on or before April 1 to
claimants who are the owners of a homestead which was granted an exemption
under subdivision (1)(b)(i) of section 77-3508 in the preceding year unless
the claimant has already filed the application for the current year or the
county assessor has reason to believe there has been a change of circumstances
so that the claimant no longer qualifies. The notice shall include the claimant's
name, the application deadlines for the current year, a list of documents
that must be filed with the application, and the county assessor's office
address and telephone number.</para>
