<para>The commissioner shall, for each calendar year, determine the combined
tax rate applicable to each employer on the basis of his or her actual experience
in the payment of contributions and with respect to benefits charged against
his or her separate experience account, in accordance with the following requirements:</para>
<para>(1) The commissioner shall, by December 1 of each calendar year, and
based upon information available through the department, determine the state
unemployment insurance tax rate for the following year. The state unemployment
insurance tax rate shall be zero percent if:</para>
<para>(a) The average balance in the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund
at the end of any three months in the preceding calendar year is greater than
one percent of state taxable wages for the same preceding year; or</para>
<para>(b) The balance in the State Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund equals
or exceeds thirty percent of the average month end balance of the state's
account in the Unemployment Trust Fund for the three lowest calendar months
in the preceding year;</para>
<para>(2)(a) If the state
unemployment insurance tax rate is not zero percent as determined in this
section, the combined tax rate shall be divided so that not less than eighty
percent of the combined tax rate equals the contribution rate and not more
than twenty percent of the combined tax rate equals the state unemployment
insurance tax rate except for employers who are assigned a combined tax rate
of five and four-tenths percent or more. For those employers, the state unemployment
insurance tax rate shall equal zero and their combined tax rate shall equal
their contribution rate. </para>
<para>(b) When the state unemployment insurance tax rate is determined to
be zero percent pursuant to subdivision (1) of this section, the contribution
rate for all employers shall equal one hundred percent of the combined tax
rate;</para>
<para>(3) In calendar year 2005, an employer's combined tax rate shall be
three and five-tenths percent of his or her annual payroll unless and until
(a) benefits have been payable from and chargeable to his or her experience
account throughout the preceding one calendar year and (b) contributions have
been payable to the fund and credited to his or her experience account with
respect to the two preceding calendar years. Subject to fair and reasonable
rules and regulations of the commissioner issued with due regard for the solvency
of the fund, in calendar year 2005 the combined tax rate required of each
employer who meets the requirements of subdivisions (a) and (b) of this subdivision
shall be based directly on his or her contributions to and benefit experience
of his or her experience account and shall be determined by the commissioner
for each calendar year at its beginning. Such rate shall not be greater than
three and five-tenths percent of his or her annual payroll if his or her experience
account exhibits a positive balance as of the beginning of such calendar year,
but for any employer who has been subject to the payment of contributions
for any two preceding calendar years, regardless of whether such years are
consecutive, and whose experience account exhibits a negative balance as of
the beginning of such calendar year, the rate shall be greater than three
and five-tenths percent of his or her annual payroll but not greater than
five and four-tenths percent of his or her annual payroll until such time
as the experience account exhibits a positive balance, and thereafter the
rate shall not be greater than three and five-tenths percent of his or her
annual payroll. For calendar year 2005, the standard rate shall be five and
four-tenths percent of the employer's annual payroll. As used in this subdivision,
standard rate shall mean the rate from which all reduced rates are calculated;</para>
<para>(4)(a) Effective January 1, 2006, an employer's combined tax rate (i)
for employers other than employers engaged in the construction industry shall
be the lesser of the state's average combined tax rate as determined pursuant
to subdivisions (4)(e), (4)(f), and (4)(g) of this section or two and five-tenths
percent and (ii) for employers in the construction industry shall be the category
twenty rate determined pursuant to subdivisions (4)(e) and (4)(f) of this
section, unless and until:</para>
<para>(A) Benefits have been payable from and chargeable to his or her experience
account throughout the preceding four calendar quarters; and</para>
<para>(B) Wages
for employment have been paid by the employer in each of the two
preceding four-calendar-quarter periods.</para>
<para>For purposes of this subdivision (4)(a), employers engaged in the construction
industry means all employers primarily engaged in business activities classified
as sector 23 business activities under the North American Industry Classification
System.</para>
<para>(b) In no event shall the combined tax rate for employers who fail to
meet the requirements of subdivision (4)(a) of this section be less than one
and twenty-five hundredths percent.</para>
<para>(c) For any employer who has not paid wages for employment during each of the
two four-calendar-quarter periods ending on September 30 of any year, but
has paid
wages for employment in any two four-calendar-quarter periods,
regardless of whether such four-calendar-quarter periods are consecutive,
such employer's combined tax rate for the following tax year shall be:</para>
<para>(i) The highest combined tax rate for employers with a positive experience
account balance if the employer's experience account balance exhibits a positive
balance as of September 30 of the year of rate computation; or</para>
<para>(ii) The standard rate if the employer's experience account exhibits
a negative balance as of September 30 of the year of rate computation.</para>
<para>(d) Beginning with rate calculations for calendar year 2006 and each
year thereafter, the combined tax rate for employers who meet the requirements
of subdivision (4)(a) of this section shall be calculated according to subdivisions
(4)(e), (4)(f), and (4)(g) of this section and shall be based upon the employer's
experience rating record and determined from the employer's reserve ratio,
which is the percent obtained by dividing the amount by which, if any, the
employer's contributions credited from the time the employer first or most
recently became an employer, whichever date is later, and up to and including
September 30 of the year the rate computation is made, plus any part of the
employer's contributions due for that year paid on or before October 31 of
such year, exceed the employer's benefits charged during the same period,
by the employer's average annual taxable payroll for the sixteen-consecutive-calendar-quarter
period ending September 30 of the year in which the rate computation is made.
For an employer with less than sixteen consecutive calendar quarters of contribution
experience, the employer's average taxable payroll shall be determined based
upon the four-calendar-quarter periods for which contributions are payable.</para>
<para>(e) Each eligible experience rated employer shall be assigned to one
of twenty rate categories with a corresponding experience factor as follows:</para>

<para>Eligible experience rated employers shall be assigned to rate categories
from highest to lowest according to their experience reserve ratio with category
one being assigned to accounts with the highest reserve ratios and category
twenty being assigned to accounts with the lowest reserve ratios. Each category
shall be limited to no more than five percent of the state's total taxable
payroll, except that:</para>
<para>(i) Any employer which has a portion of its taxable wages fall into
one category and a portion into the next higher category shall be assigned
to the lower category;</para>
<para>(ii) No employer with a reserve ratio calculated to five decimal places
equal to another employer similarly calculated shall be assigned to a higher
rate than the employer to which it has the equal reserve ratio; and</para>
<para>(iii) No employer with
a positive experience account balance shall be assigned to category twenty.</para>
<para>(f) The state's reserve ratio shall be calculated by dividing the amount
available to pay benefits in the Unemployment Trust Fund and the State Unemployment
Insurance Trust Fund as of September 30, 2005, and each September 30 thereafter,
less any outstanding obligations and amounts appropriated therefrom by the
state's total wages from the four calendar quarters ending on such September
30. For purposes of this section, total wages means all remuneration paid
by an employer in employment. The state's reserve ratio shall be applied to
the table in this subdivision to determine the yield factor for the upcoming
rate year.</para>

</para>
<para>Once the yield factor for the upcoming rate year has been determined,
it is multiplied by the amount of unemployment benefits paid from combined
tax during the four calendar quarters ending September 30 of the preceding
year. The resulting figure is the planned yield for the rate year. The planned
yield is divided by the total taxable wages for the four calendar quarters
ending September 30 of the previous year and carried to four decimal places
to create the average combined tax rate for the rate year.</para>
<para>(g) The average combined tax rate is assigned to rate category twelve
as established in subdivision (4)(e) of this section. Rates for each of the
remaining nineteen categories are determined by multiplying the average combined
tax rate by the experience factor associated with each category and carried
to four decimal places. Employers who are delinquent in filing their combined
tax reports as of October 31 of any year shall be assigned to category twenty
for the following calendar year unless the delinquency is corrected prior
to December 31 of the year of rate calculation.</para>
<para>(h) As used in this subdivision (4) of this section, standard rate means
the rate assigned to category twenty for that year. For calendar years 2006
and thereafter, the standard rate shall be not less than five and four-tenths
percent of the employer's annual taxable payroll;</para>
<para>(5) Any employer may at any time make voluntary contributions up to
the amount necessary to qualify for one rate category reduction, additional
to the required contributions, to the fund to be credited to his or her account.
Voluntary contributions received after March 10, 2005, for rate year 2005
or January 10 for rate year 2006 and thereafter shall not be used in rate
calculations for the same calendar year;</para>
<para>(6) As used in sections 48-648 to 48-654, the term payroll means the
total amount of wages during a calendar year, except as otherwise provided
in section 48-654, by which the combined tax was measured; and</para>
<para>(7)(a) The state or any of its instrumentalities shall make payments
in lieu of contributions in an amount equal to the full amount of regular
benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid during each
calendar quarter that is attributable to service in employment of the state
or any of its instrumentalities. The commissioner after the end of each calendar
quarter shall notify any state instrumentality or other public employer of
the amount of regular benefits and one-half the amount of extended benefits
paid that are attributable to service in its employment and the instrumentality
or public employer so notified shall reimburse the fund within thirty days
after receipt of such notice. For all tax years beginning before January
1, 2010, the commissioner may require that any employer whose
annual payroll for either of the two preceding calendar years has equaled
or exceeded five hundred thousand dollars to pay the reimbursement by an electronic
method approved by the commissioner, except when the employer establishes
to the satisfaction of the commissioner that payment of the reimbursement
by an electronic method would work a hardship on the employer. For all tax years beginning on or after
January 1, 2010, the commissioner may require any employer whose annual payroll
for either of the two preceding calendar years has equaled or exceeded one
hundred thousand dollars to pay the reimbursement by an electronic method
approved by the commissioner, except when the employer establishes to the
satisfaction of the commissioner that payment of the reimbursement by an electronic
method would work a hardship on the employer.</para>
<para>(b) After December 31, 1977, the state or any of its political subdivisions
and any instrumentality of one or more of the foregoing or any other governmental
entity for which services in employment as is provided by subdivision (4)(a)
of section 48-604 are performed shall be required to pay contributions and
after December 31, 1996, combined tax on wages paid for services rendered
in its or their employment on the same basis as any other employer who is
liable for the payment of combined tax under the Employment Security Law,
unless the state or any political subdivision thereof and any instrumentality
of one or more of the foregoing or any other governmental entity for which
such services are performed files with the commissioner its written election
not later than January 31, 1978, or if such employer becomes subject to this
section after January 1, 1978, not later than thirty days after such subjectivity
begins, to become liable to make payments in lieu of contributions in an amount
equal to the full amount of regular benefits plus one-half of the amount of
extended benefits paid during each calendar quarter that is attributable to
service in employment of such electing employer prior to December 31, 1978,
and in an amount equal to the full amount of regular benefits plus the full
amount of extended benefits paid during each calendar quarter that is attributable
to service in employment of such electing employer after January 1, 1979.
Eligible employers electing to make payments in lieu of contributions shall
not be liable for state unemployment insurance tax payments. The commissioner,
after the end of each calendar quarter, shall notify any such employer that
has so elected of the amount of benefits for which it is liable to pay pursuant
to its election that have been paid that are attributable to service in its
employment and the employer so notified shall reimburse the fund within thirty
days after receipt of such notice.</para>
<para>(c) Any employer which makes an election in accordance with subdivision
(b) of this subdivision to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions
shall continue to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions for all
benefits paid based upon wages paid for service in employment of such employer
while such election is effective and such election shall continue until such
employer files with the commissioner, not later than December 1 of any calendar
year, a written notice terminating its election as of December 31 of that
year and thereafter such employer shall again be liable for the payment of
contributions and for the reimbursement of such benefits as may be paid based
upon wages paid for services in employment of such employer while such election
was effective.</para>
