<para>(1) Combined
taxes or payments in lieu of contributions unpaid on the date on which they
are due and payable, as prescribed by the commissioner, shall bear interest
at the rate of one and one-half percent per month from such date until payment,
plus accrued interest, is received by the commissioner, except that no interest
shall be charged subsequent to the date of the erroneous payment of an amount
equal to the amount of the delayed payment into the unemployment trust fund
of another state or to the federal government. Interest collected pursuant
to this section shall be paid in accordance with subdivision (1)(b) of section
48-621. If, after due notice, any employer defaults in any payment of combined
taxes or payments in lieu of contributions or interest thereon, the amount
due may be collected (a) by civil action in the
name of the commissioner and the employer adjudged in default shall pay the
costs of such action or (b) by setoff against any
state income tax refund due the employer pursuant to sections 77-27,197 to
77-27,209. Civil actions brought under this section to collect combined taxes
or interest thereon or payments in lieu of contributions or interest thereon
from an employer shall be heard by the court at the earliest possible date
and shall be entitled to preference upon the calendar of the court over all
other civil actions except petitions for judicial review under section 48-638.</para>
<para>(2) The commissioner
may by rule and regulation provide for the offset from a person's personal
federal income tax refund of contributions, penalties, and interest due and
payable for which the commissioner has determined the person to be liable
due to fraud and which remain uncollected for not more than ten years. Such
rules and regulations shall comply with Public Law 110-328 (2008) and United
States Treasury regulations and guidelines adopted pursuant thereto. The commissioner
shall notify the debtor, by certified mail return receipt requested, that
the commissioner plans to recover the debt through offset against any federal
income tax refund, and the debtor shall be given sixty days to present evidence
that all or part of the liability is either not legally enforceable or not
due to fraud. The commissioner shall review any evidence presented and determine
that the debt is legally enforceable and due to fraud before proceeding further
with the offset. The amount recovered, less any administrative fees charged
by the United States Treasury, shall be credited to the debt owed. Any determination
rendered under this subsection that the person's federal income tax refund
is not subject to offset does not require the commissioner to amend the commissioner's
initial determination that formed the basis for the proposed offset.</para>
