In all such cases, a complete record shall be kept of all such references, which record shall, during all business hours, be open for the inspection of the Commissioner of Labor or any inspector appointed by the commissioner to make such inspections, and upon demand shall be subject to the inspection and examination by the applicant. For such registration fee a receipt shall be given to the applicant for employment or help, giving the name of such applicant, the date of payment, and the character of the position or help applied for, and the receipt shall have printed or stamped on the front thereof, in the English language, the name of the Commissioner of Labor and his address. Such registration fee shall be returned to the applicant on demand, after thirty days and within sixty days from the date of receipt, less the amount that has been actually expended by such private employment agency for the applicant, and an itemized account of such expenditures shall be presented to the applicant on request at the time of returning the unused portion of such registration fee if no position or help has been furnished by the private employment agency to and accepted by the applicant.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1972, LB 1460, &#167; 7; </para><para>Laws 1977, LB 162, &#167; 14. </para></source></law></legaldoc>
