In no event shall the benefit amount based on employment for any employer be reduced to less than one benefit week when the individual was or could have been determined disqualified under subdivision (1) of section 48-628. For purposes of sections 48-623 to 48-626, wages shall be counted as wages for insured work for benefit purposes with respect to any benefit year only if such benefit year begins subsequent to the date on which the employer by whom such wages were paid has satisfied the conditions of section 48-603 or subsection (3) of section 48-661 with respect to becoming an employer. In order to determine the benefits due under this section and sections 48-624 and 48-625, each employer shall make reports, in conformity with reasonable rules and regulations adopted by the commissioner, of the wages of any claimant. If any such employer shall fail to make such report within the time prescribed, the commissioner may accept the statement of such claimant as to his or her wages, and any benefit payments based on such statement of earnings, in the absence of fraud or collusion, will be final as to amount.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1937, c. 108, &#167; 3, p. 375; </para><para>Laws 1939, c. 56, &#167; 2, p. 235; </para><para>Laws 1941, c. 94, &#167; 2, p. 382; </para><para>C.S.Supp.,1941, &#167; 48-703; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 48-626; </para><para>Laws 1945, c. 114, &#167; 3, p. 372; </para><para>Laws 1949, c. 163, &#167; 9, p. 425; </para><para>Laws 1959, c. 229, &#167; 2, p. 802; </para><para>Laws 1963, c. 291, &#167; 2, p. 871; </para><para>Laws 1967, c. 300, &#167; 1, p. 816; </para><para>Laws 1972, LB 1392, &#167; 4; </para><para>Laws 1980, LB 800, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 1985, LB 339, &#167; 20; </para><para>Laws 1986, LB 950, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 1995, LB 1, &#167; 7. </para></source><annotation><para>The duration of maximum benefits is not affected by discharge for ordinary misconduct.
