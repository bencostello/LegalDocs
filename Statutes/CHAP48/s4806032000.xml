of a determination upon a claim shall be promptly given to the claimant by
delivery thereof or by mailing such notice to his or her last-known address.
In addition, notice of any determination, together with the reasons therefor,
shall be promptly given in the same manner to any employer from whom
claimant received wages on or after
the first day of the base period for his or her most recent claim,
and who has indicated prior to the determination, in such manner as required
by rule and regulation of the commissioner, that such individual may be ineligible
or disqualified under any provision of the Employment Security Law. An employer shall provide information
to the department in respect to the request for information within ten days
after the mailing or electronic transmission of a request.</para>
<para>(2) If the employer provided
information pursuant to subsection (7) of section 48-652 on the claim establishing
the previous benefit year but did not receive a determination because of no
involvement of base period wages and there are wages from that employer in
the base period for the most recent claim, the employer shall be provided
the opportunity to provide new information that such individual may be ineligible
or disqualified under any provision of the Employment Security Law on the
current claim. This subsection shall not apply to employers who did not receive
a determination because the separation was determined to result from a lack
of work.</para><para>(3)
On or after October 1, 2012, if an employer fails to provide information to
the department within the time period specified in subsection (1) of this
section, the employer shall forfeit any appeal rights otherwise available
