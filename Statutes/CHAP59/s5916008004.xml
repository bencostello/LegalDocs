Cash Fund; created; use; investment.</catchline><para>The State Settlement
Cash Fund is created. The fund shall be maintained by the Department of Justice
and administered by the Attorney General. Except as otherwise provided by
law, the fund shall consist of all recoveries received pursuant to the Consumer
Protection Act, including any money, funds, securities, or other things of
value in the nature of civil damages or other payment, except criminal penalties,
whether such recovery is by way of verdict, judgment, compromise, or settlement
in or out of court, or other final disposition of any case or controversy,
or any other payments received on behalf of the state by the Department of
Justice and administered by the Attorney General for the benefit of the state
or the general welfare of its citizens, but excluding all funds held in a
trust capacity where specific benefits accrue to specific individuals, organizations,
or governments. All money in the fund shall be subject to legislative review
and shall be appropriated and expended for any allowable legal purposes as
determined by the Legislature. The fund shall only be appropriated to a separate
and distinct budget program and such appropriations shall only be expended
from a separate and distinct budget subprogram and shall not be commingled
with any other revenue or expenditure. Transfers may be made from the fund
to the General Fund and the
State DNA Sample and Data Base Fund at the direction of the Legislature.
To provide necessary financial accountability and management oversight, revenue
from individual settlement agreements or other separate sources credited to
the State Settlement Cash Fund may be tracked and accounted for within the
state accounting system through the use of separate and distinct funds, subfunds,
or any other available accounting mechanism specifically approved by the Accounting
Administrator for use by the Department of Justice. Any money in the fund
available for investment shall be invested by the state investment officer
pursuant to the Nebraska Capital Expansion Act and the Nebraska State Funds
Investment Act.</para>
