<para>(1) During each calendar year in which funds are available
from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund for use by the Department of Economic
Development, the department shall allocate a specific amount of funds, not
less than twenty-five percent, to each congressional district. Entitlement
area funds allocated under this section that are not awarded to an eligible
project from within the entitlement area within one year shall be made available
for distribution to eligible projects elsewhere in the state. The department
shall announce a grant and loan application period of at least ninety days
duration for all nonentitlement areas. In selecting projects to receive trust
fund assistance, the department shall develop a qualified allocation plan
and give first priority to financially viable projects that serve the lowest
income occupants for the longest period of time. The qualified allocation
plan shall:</para>
<para>(a) Set forth selection criteria to be used to determine housing
priorities of the housing trust fund which are appropriate to local conditions,
including the community's immediate need for affordable housing, proposed
increases in home ownership, private dollars leveraged, level of local government
support and participation, and repayment, in part or in whole, of financial
assistance awarded by the fund; and</para>
<para>(b) Give first priority in allocating trust fund assistance
among selected projects to those projects which serve the lowest income occupant
and are obligated to serve qualified occupants for the longest period of time.</para>
<para>(2) The department shall fund in order of priority as many
applications as will utilize available funds less actual administrative costs
of the department in administering the program. In administering the program
the department may contract for services or directly provide funds to other
governmental entities or instrumentalities.</para>
<para>(3) The department
may recapture any funds which were allocated to a qualified recipient for
an eligible project through an award agreement if such funds were not utilized
for eligible costs within the time of performance under the agreement and
are therefor no longer obligated to the project. The recaptured funds shall
be credited to the Industrial Recovery Fund except as provided in section
81-1213.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1996, LB 1322, &#167; 18; </para><para>Laws 2005, LB 40, &#167; 3; </para><para>Laws 2011, LB388, &#167; 13.</para></source>  </law>
