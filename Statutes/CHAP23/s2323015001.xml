for disability; application; when; medical examination.</catchline><para>(1)
Any member, disregarding the length of service, may be retired as a result
of disability either upon his or her own application or upon the application
of his or her employer or any person acting in his or her behalf. Before any
member may be so retired, a medical examination shall be made at the expense
of the retirement system, which examination shall be conducted by a disinterested
physician legally authorized to practice medicine under the laws of the state
in which he or she practices, such physician to be selected by the retirement
board, and the physician shall certify to the board that the member should
be retired because he or she suffers from an inability to engage in a substantially
gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental
impairment which began while
the member was a participant in the plan and which can be expected
to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration. The
application for disability retirement shall be made within one year of termination
of employment.</para>
<para>(2) The retirement board may require any disability beneficiary
who has not attained the age of fifty-five to undergo a medical
examination at the expense of the board once each year. Should any disability
beneficiary refuse to undergo such an examination, his or her disability retirement
benefit may be discontinued by the board.</para>
