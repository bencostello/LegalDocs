otherwise provided in this section, a member of the retirement system who
has a five-year break in service shall upon reemployment be considered a new
employee with respect to the County Employees Retirement Act and shall not
receive credit for service prior to his or her reemployment date.</para>
<para>(2)(a) A member who ceases to be an employee before becoming
eligible for retirement under section 23-2315 and again becomes a permanent
full-time or permanent part-time county employee prior to having a five-year
break in service shall immediately be reenrolled in the retirement system
and resume making contributions. For purposes of vesting employer contributions
made prior to and after the reentry into the retirement system under subsection
(3) of section 23-2319, years of participation include years of participation
prior to such employee's original termination. For a member who is not vested
and has received a termination benefit pursuant to section 23-2319, the years
of participation prior to such employee's original termination shall be limited
in a ratio equal to the amount that the member repays divided by the termination
benefit withdrawn pursuant to section 23-2319.</para>
<para>(b) The reemployed member may repay the value of, or a portion
of the value of, the termination benefit withdrawn pursuant to section 23-2319.
A reemployed member who elects to repay all or a portion of the value of the
termination benefit withdrawn pursuant to section 23-2319 shall repay the
actual earnings on such value. Repayment of the termination benefit shall
commence within three years of reemployment and shall be completed within
five years of reemployment or prior to termination of employment, whichever
occurs first, through (i) direct payments to the retirement system, (ii) installment
payments made pursuant to a binding irrevocable payroll deduction authorization
made by the member, (iii) an eligible rollover distribution as provided under
the Internal Revenue Code, or (iv) a direct rollover distribution made in
accordance with section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code.</para>
<para>(c) The value of the member's forfeited employer account or
employer cash balance account, as of the date of forfeiture, shall be restored
in a ratio equal to the amount of the benefit that the member has repaid divided
by the termination benefit received. The employer account or employer cash
balance account shall be restored first out of the current forfeiture amounts
and then by additional employer contributions.</para>
<para>(3) For a member who retired pursuant to section 23-2315 and
becomes a permanent full-time employee or permanent part-time employee with
a county under the County Employees Retirement Act more than one hundred twenty
days after his or her retirement date, the member shall continue receiving
retirement benefits. Such a retired member or a retired member who received
a lump-sum distribution of his or her benefit shall be considered a new employee
as of the date of reemployment and shall not receive credit for any service
prior to the member's retirement for purposes of the act.</para>
<para>(4) A member who is reinstated as an employee pursuant to
a grievance or appeal of his or her termination by the county shall be a member
upon reemployment and shall not be considered to have a break in service for
such period of time that the grievance or appeal was pending. Following reinstatement, the member shall repay the value
of the amount received from his or her employee account or member cash balance
account under subdivision (2)(b) of section 23-2319.01.</para>
