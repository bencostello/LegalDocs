the event of the death before his or her retirement date of any employee who
is a member of the system, the death benefit shall be equal to (1) for participants
in the defined contribution benefit, the total of the employee account and
the employer account and (2) for participants in the cash balance benefit,
the benefit provided in section 23-2308.01. The death benefit shall be paid
to the member's beneficiary, to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified
domestic relations order as provided in section 42-1107, or to the member's
estate if there are no designated beneficiaries. If the beneficiary is not
the member's surviving spouse, the death benefit shall be paid as a lump-sum
payment or payments, except that the entire account must be distributed by
the fifth anniversary of the member's death. If the sole primary beneficiary
is the member's surviving spouse, the surviving spouse may elect to receive
an annuity calculated as if the member retired and selected a one-hundred-percent
joint and survivor annuity effective on the annuity purchase date. If the
surviving spouse does not elect the annuity option within one hundred eighty days after the death of the member, the
surviving spouse shall receive a lump-sum payment or payments, except that
the entire account must be distributed by the fifth anniversary of the member's
death.</para>
