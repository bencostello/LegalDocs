If considered necessary by the State Fire Marshal, the order may direct that the building be closed and not used or occupied until such exits and means of egress are provided. If increased exiting capacity does not correct overcrowded conditions, occupancy limits shall be strictly enforced.</para></amendatorysection></section><source><para>Laws 1925, c. 183, &#167; 13, p. 484; </para><para>C.S.1929, &#167; 81-5513; </para><para>R.S.1943, &#167; 81-514; </para><para>Laws 1988, LB 893, &#167; 14. </para></source><crossreference><para><emphasis>For requirement of fire escapes,</emphasis> see section 48-420.</para></crossreference></law></legaldoc>
