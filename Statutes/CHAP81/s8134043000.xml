<para>A complaint against any person or organization involving
any matter coming within the jurisdiction of the board shall be in writing
and shall be filed with the board. The complaint, at the discretion
of the board, shall be heard within a reasonable time in accordance with the
rules and regulations and may be heard through the use of a hearing officer.
The accused shall have the right to appear personally with or without counsel,
to cross-examine adverse witnesses, and to produce evidence and witnesses
in his, her, or its defense. The board
shall set the time and place for the hearing and shall cause a copy of the complaint, together with a notice of the time
and place fixed for the hearing, to be sent by registered mail to the accused,
at his, her, or its last-known business
or residence address known to the board, at least thirty days before the hearing.
If after the hearing the board finds the accused has violated the Engineers
and Architects Regulation Act or any rules or regulations, it may issue any
order or take any action described in section 81-3444. If the board finds
no violation, it shall enter an order dismissing the complaint. If
the order revokes, suspends, or cancels a license, the board shall notify,
in writing, the Secretary of State and the clerk of the city or village in
the state where the person or
organization has a place of business, if any. The board may reissue
a license that has
been revoked. Application for the reissuance of a license shall be made in
such a manner as the board directs and shall be accompanied by a fee established
by the board.</para>
