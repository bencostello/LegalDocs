<para>It is the intent
of the Legislature to evolve Nebraska's economic development and job creation
policies in order to remain competitive by adopting recommendations from the
statewide strategic plan developed by the Innovation and Entrepreneurship
Task Force. The strategic plan recognizes that Nebraska's current policy tools
targeted to fostering high-wage job growth among small businesses, entrepreneurs,
and innovators have not kept pace with other states and jurisdictions. Nebraska
has a clear opportunity to improve our entrepreneurial ecosystem by adopting
proactive policy solutions with demonstrated positive results.</para>
