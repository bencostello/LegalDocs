procedure.</catchline><para>(1) To pay the expense of the maintenance and
operation of the office of the commission and the enforcement of the Nebraska
Real Estate License Act, the commission shall, at the time an application
is submitted, collect from an applicant for each broker's or salesperson's
examination a fee to be established by the commission of not more than two hundred fifty dollars and an application
fee of not more than two hundred fifty dollars.
The commission shall also collect a reexamination fee to be established by
the commission of not more than two hundred fifty dollars
for each reexamination. The commission may direct an applicant to pay the
examination or reexamination fee to a third party who has contracted with
the commission to administer the examination. An
applicant who is granted a license under section 81-885.17 without being
required to take an examination shall not be required to pay the examination
and application fees. Prior to the issuance of an original license, each applicant
who has passed the examination required by section 81-885.13 or who has received
a license under section
81-885.17 shall pay a license fee to be established by the commission.
The license fee established by the commission shall not exceed the following
amounts: For a broker's license, not more than two hundred fifty dollars; and for a salesperson's
license, not more than two
hundred dollars. After the original issuance of a license, a renewal
application and an annual fee to be established by the commission of not more
than two hundred fifty dollars for each broker,
and not more than two hundred dollars for each salesperson, shall
be due and payable on or before the last day of November of each year. Failure
to remit annual fees when due shall automatically cancel such license on December
31 of that year, but otherwise the license shall remain in full force and
effect continuously from the date of issuance unless suspended or revoked
by the commission for just cause. Any licensee who fails to file an application
for the renewal of any license and pay the renewal fee as provided in this
section may file a late renewal application and shall pay, in addition to
the renewal fee, an amount to be established by the commission of not more
than twenty-five dollars for each month or fraction thereof beginning with
the first day of December if such late application is filed before July 1
of the ensuing year. Any check presented to the commission as a fee for either
an original or renewal license or for examination for license which is returned
to the State Treasurer unpaid or
any electronic payment presented to the commission as a fee for either an
original or renewal license or for examination for license that is not accepted
against the commission shall be cause for revocation or denial
of license.</para>
<para>(2) An inactive broker or salesperson may renew his or her license by
submitting an application before December 1 prior to the ensuing year. Such
broker or salesperson shall submit the renewal fee together with the completed
renewal application on which he or she has noted his or her present inactive
status. Any broker or salesperson whose license has been renewed on such inactive
status shall not be permitted to engage in the real estate business until
such time as he or she fulfills the requirements for active status. Any license
which has been inactive for a continuous period of more than three years shall
be reinstated only if the licensee has met the examination requirement of
an original applicant.</para>
