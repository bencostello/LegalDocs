expire on the last day of December following their issuance or renewal and
shall become invalid on that date unless renewed before the expiration date
with the payment of a fee in an amount the board shall determine. The board
shall notify every licensee of the expiration
date of his or her certificate and the amount of the annual renewal fee at
least one month in advance. The fee to be paid for the renewal of a certificate
after December 31 shall be increased by ten percent for each month or fraction
of a month such payment is delayed, except that the maximum fee for a delayed renewal shall
not exceed twice the amount of the original renewal fee and no renewals shall
be made after a lapse of one year after the original expiration
date thereof. Renewal fees shall not be required while the professional landscape architect is on active
duty with the armed forces of the United States. Application for renewal of
a lapsed license shall be in the same
manner as provided for an original application pursuant to section 81-8,196.</para>
